<h2 id="Preface">Preface</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p>The object of this work is to furnish in an inexpensive
and convenient form, plain directions on healthful cookery.
Special attention has been given to the idea of presenting
such recipes as will tend to make the living of the family
what it should be,—simple, economical, wholesome, nutritious,
palatable, and varied.</p>

<p>The housewife is often perplexed to know just what to
cook; but if she has at hand something which will suggest
to her what she desires but can not think of, she has that
which is indeed a friend.</p>

<p>The author has tried to make the work sufficiently
comprehensive to answer the demands of an ordinary
household.</p>

<p>The recipes for the preparation of grains, fruits, nuts,
and vegetables occupy a large portion of the work. Cream
is mentioned in a number of the recipes, but while its use
is to be preferred instead of butter, especially if sterilized,
substitutes have generally been suggested where it is not
at hand or available.</p>

<p>Pains have been taken to make the recipes plain and
explicit, and yet as brief as possible consistent with these
ends. The amount of the various ingredients required
has generally been indicated by measure, rather than by
weight, as this is usually more convenient and time-saving.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this little work will be found to be a
real friend in the kitchen. That it may be such, and that
it may prove a blessing to thousands in many lands, is the
sincere wish of—</p>

<h2 id="IMPORTANCE_OF_GOOD_COOKING">IMPORTANCE OF GOOD COOKING</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Healthful</span> cookery is not receiving the attention
which its importance demands. Although we are
living at a time when eating and drinking are carried to
excess, and when elaborate bills of fare are frequently
placed before us, yet plain, simple, and healthful cookery
occupies but a comparatively small place in the culinary
world to-day.</p>

<p>Good food is of primary importance. We live upon
what we eat. It is not sufficient, however, merely to select
good food. To be well digested and thoroughly assimilated
the food must be properly prepared. The best food may
be spoiled in cooking. The kind of food upon which we
live, and the manner in which it is prepared, determines
largely our physical well-being, and consequently much of
our happiness or misery in this life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“For love, nor honor, wealth, nor power,</div>
   <div class="verse">Can give the heart a cheerful hour</div>
   <div class="verse">When health is lost. Be timely wise;</div>
   <div class="verse">With health all taste of pleasure flies.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Moreover, the mind is affected by the condition of the
body, and the morals by the state of the mind. As, therefore,
cooking determines to a large degree the condition
of the body, it must also affect to a considerable extent
our moral and spiritual welfare. It is not too much to
say, therefore, that there is religion in good cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>It has been truly said that “the cook fills an important
place in the household. She is preparing food to be taken
into the stomach, to form brain, bone, and muscle. The
health of all the members of the family depends largely
upon her skill and intelligence.” As the lives of those on
a steamship are in the hands of the helmsman, so the lives
and the health of the members of the family are, to a great
degree, in the hands of the one who prepares their meals.</p>

<p>Thousands are dying annually as the result of poor
cooking. Food poorly prepared is not nutritious, and can
not, therefore, make good blood.</p>

<p>Some may say they have no natural ability to cook;
but any one having ordinary intelligence, with a little
effort, care, and proper directions, can learn to cook well.
And surely the health of the family ought to be of sufficient
importance to inspire every mother with ambition to
learn how to cook.</p>

<p>Mothers should also teach their daughters the mysteries
of good cooking. They should show them that this is an
essential part of their education,—more essential than the
study of music, fancy work, the dead languages, or the
sciences. The knowledge of these latter without the knowledge
of how to care for the body and provide it with suitable
nourishment, is of little worth. Meredith hit upon a
great truth when he said:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“We may live without music, poetry, and art;</div>
   <div class="verse">We may live without conscience, and live without heart,</div>
   <div class="verse">We may live without friends; we may live without books;</div>
   <div class="verse">But civilized man can not live without cooks.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No young woman should contemplate marriage until
she has first acquired a practical knowledge of simple
cookery, for this is essential, whether she expects to do
the cooking herself, or supervise the maid. Although bread
is the staff of life, it is a sad fact that a large proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the daughters of the present generation do not know
how to make a good loaf of bread. They have not been
instructed in the useful art of cookery, so that when they
have families of their own they can provide for their tables
a well-cooked dinner, prepared with nicety, so that they
would not blush to place it before their most esteemed
friends.</p>

<p>There has never been an age so noted for dyspeptics as
the present, and there was perhaps never before a time
when there was a greater scarcity of good cooks.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Though we boast of modern progress as aloft we proudly soar</div>
   <div class="verse">Above untutored cannibals whose habits we deplore,</div>
   <div class="verse">Yet in our daily papers any day you chance to look</div>
   <div class="verse">You may find this advertisement: ‘Wanted—A Girl to Cook.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Good cooking does not consist in the preparation of
highly seasoned foods to pamper a perverted appetite,
but in cooking with simplicity, variety, and skill natural
foods in a palatable and wholesome manner. To assist in
this direction is the object of this little work.</p>

<p>But no workman can work without materials and tools.
The necessary materials for cooking are indicated in the
recipes given in this book. Illustrations of many of the
most necessary and useful cooking utensils will be found
scattered throughout the work.</p>

<p>A very convenient and easily constructed wall rack,
which may be placed over the kitchen work table, is shown

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Soup</span> is easily prepared, economical, and when made
from healthful materials, is a very wholesome article
of diet. It adds much to the elegance and relish of a
dinner, and, if taken in small quantities, is a good means
of preparing the whole system to assimilate a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Soups afford an excellent opportunity for using left-over
foods which might otherwise be wasted. A combination
of vegetables left over from the previous day, such as a
cupful of mashed potatoes, some stewed peas, beans, or
lentils, a few spoonfuls of boiled rice, stewed tomatoes, or
other bits of vegetables or grains, if in good order, make a
very palatable and nourishing soup. The vegetables should
be put all together in a saucepan with enough water to
cover them, let simmer for an hour or two, then rubbed
through a colander, and returned to the saucepan with
sufficient water added to make the soup of proper consistency,
reheated, seasoned, and served.</p>

<p>For seasoning soup, a few spoonfuls of cream, or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
little butter or nut butter may be used, though, if properly
made, it is quite relishable without.</p>

<p>We wish all our readers success with the following
simple but delicious kinds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg" alt="three leaves separator" /></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>BEAN SOUP</h3>

<p>For two quarts of soup soak one pint of beans overnight. In
the morning drain, and put to cook in cold water, adding one-third
cup of well-washed rice if desired; boil slowly for about
two hours. When done, rub through a colander, thin with
boiling water, and season with a little butter and salt.</p>


<h3>POTATO SOUP</h3>

<p>Pare and slice three medium-sized potatoes, and put to cook
with a tablespoonful of chopped onion, or stalk of celery
chopped fine, in sufficient water to cover. If celery is not at
hand, one-half teaspoonful of celery salt may be used instead.
Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan over the fire,
then add two tablespoonfuls of flour, stir well, and cook one
minute; then add gradually one quart of milk, stirring constantly
until thickened. Simmer for ten minutes. As soon as
the potatoes are done, and the water nearly absorbed, rub,
without draining, through a colander, and add them to the hot,
thickened milk. Season with salt, and serve.</p>


<h3>GREEN PEA SOUP</h3>

<p>Add to a quart of green peas a teaspoonful of sugar and
enough water to cover; cook gently until tender, and the water
quite absorbed. Then rub through a colander, add a quart of
milk, salt to taste, and return to the fire. Heat to boiling, then
add a spoonful of flour, mixed smooth with a little butter, then
to a thin paste with a little of the soup. Simmer for a few minutes,
and serve with croutons. If desired, a little onion or
celery may be added for seasoning during the last few minutes
of cooking, and then be removed.</p>


<h3>SPLIT PEA SOUP</h3>

<p>Wash one cupful of dried, split peas, and soak for several
hours, or overnight, in cold water. Then put to cook in three
pints of cold water, and boil slowly until thoroughly dissolved,
adding more water occasionally to keep the quantity good.
Stir up frequently from the bottom of the kettle. Rub through
a colander; add water or rich milk to make the proper consistency,
and return to the fire. Brown slightly one tablespoonful
of flour in a tablespoonful of butter or cooking oil, then thin it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
with a few spoonfuls of the hot soup; stir this into the boiling
soup, with salt to taste; simmer for ten minutes, and serve. An
onion chopped fine and browned with the flour may be used for
seasoning; also a cupful of tomatoes may be cooked with the
peas before straining, if desired.</p>


<h3>SPLIT PEA AND VERMICELLI SOUP</h3>

<p>Make the soup as above. Cook one-half cup of vermicelli
in a cupful of boiling water for ten minutes and add to the soup.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SOUP</h3>

<p>Put a quart can of tomatoes in a porcelain stewpan, add a
pint of water, and stew until well done. Brown lightly in a
frying-pan a tablespoonful of finely chopped onion in a tablespoonful
of butter or cooking oil; then mix in a tablespoonful
of flour or cornstarch; thin this with a little of the soup, and
then stir it into the soup. Simmer for ten minutes, run through
a colander, reheat, add salt to taste, and serve hot with croutons.</p>


<h3>CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP</h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of canned or fresh tomatoes, add a cupful
of water, one teaspoonful of minced onion, and, if desired, a
little chopped celery; stew till tender, then rub through a colander.
Heat one quart of milk to boiling. Have mixed smooth
one tablespoonful of butter and one level tablespoonful of flour,
then thin with a little of the hot milk. Stir this into the milk
as soon as it starts to boil, and cook for several minutes, adding
salt to taste. Then add the tomatoes. Do not cook or let stand
after the tomatoes are added, but serve at once.</p>


<h3>LENTIL SOUP</h3>

<p>Cook one cupful of lentils, previously soaked an hour or two
in about a quart of water, until tender. Rub through a colander;
return to the fire, adding enough boiling water to make a quart
in all, a small onion cut in slices, and salt to taste. When heated
to boiling, thicken to the consistency of cream with browned
flour. Season with a little butter or a few spoonfuls of sweet
cream. If butter is used it should be mixed or braided with
the flour, then thinned with enough of the soup so that it can
be easily poured in. Simmer for ten minutes after adding the
flour. Remove the onion before serving. The German or dark
lentils are usually cheaper than the Egyptian or red lentils.</p>


<h3>LENTIL AND TOMATO SOUP</h3>

<p>Soak one cupful of lentils in cold water for a few hours, then
cook in a quart of water until tender, with one small onion,
three or four fresh tomatoes, or two cupfuls of stewed ones,
and a tablespoonful of nut butter, if desired. Rub through a
colander, add hot water to make three pints in all, reheat to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
boiling, and slightly thicken with a spoonful of browned flour
mixed with a little cold water. Season with a small lump of
butter or a few spoonfuls of cream.</p>


<h3>TOMATO AND MACARONI SOUP</h3>

<p>Drop a cupful of macaroni broken into small pieces into
three or four cupfuls of boiling, slightly salted, water; boil
from thirty to sixty minutes, or until tender, the length of
time required depending upon whether the macaroni is fresh
or stale. Have stewing one quart of fresh or canned tomatoes,
and when done, rub through a colander; drain the macaroni,
and add it to the tomatoes, with hot water to make about three
pints in all. Reheat, season with salt and a little butter, and,
after removing from the fire, add a few spoonfuls of sweet
cream if convenient. Serve as soon as the cream is added.</p>


<h3>RICE SOUP</h3>

<p>Wash one-third cup of rice and put to cook in about three
cupfuls of water, adding a little salt; cook until tender. Then
add one quart of milk, and salt to taste; reheat to boiling. Have
ready a tablespoonful of butter mixed smooth with a tablespoonful
of flour, then made thin with a little of the hot milk; pour
this into the soup and simmer for ten minutes. Celery may be
added for flavoring if desired. Also, if desired richer, a beaten
yolk of egg, first mixed with a few spoonfuls of the hot soup
to prevent coagulating, may be added to the soup a few minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3>SAGO PEA SOUP</h3>

<p>Wash, soak, and cook one cupful of split peas in plenty of
water until tender; rub through a colander, return to the fire,
adding enough hot water to make three pints in all, and a few
slices of onion. Wash three tablespoonfuls of sago in warm
water, and stir gradually into the soup; simmer for a half-hour,
or until well dissolved. Remove the onion, and season with
salt. Add a few spoonfuls of thin cream or rich milk to the
beaten yolk of an egg, and stir into the soup a few minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3>SAGO FRUIT SOUP (SUMMER)</h3>

<p>Soak one-half cup of sago for an hour in a cup of cold water;
then add a quart of hot water, and simmer until transparent.
In the meantime cook together one cup of prunes and one-half
cup of raisins in a small quantity of water. When the sago is
transparent, add the fruit, together with one-half cup of currant,
plum, or some other tart fruit juice, and one-half cup of sugar.
This will make three pints of soup. Serve hot with croutons.</p>

<p>Instead of the above, rice with dried apricots, and prune or
currant juice may be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>


<h3>VEGETABLE SOUP (SUMMER)</h3>

<p>Take a cupful each of chopped turnips, carrots, cauliflower
or cabbage, several young onions cut fine, one cupful of green
peas, one tablespoonful parsley or bay leaves for flavoring, and
stew together in a stewpan with water to cover for six or eight
minutes; then drain, cover with fresh boiling water, and stew
slowly until tender, and the water nearly absorbed. Strain
through a colander. Add enough hot rich milk or cream to
make quite thin, salt to taste, reheat, and serve.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE SOUP (WINTER)</h3>

<p>Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a stewpan or soup
kettle, add one onion chopped fine, and brown nicely; stir frequently
to prevent burning. To this add a tablespoonful of
flour, mix thoroughly, then pour in slowly a pint of hot water,
stirring to keep smooth. Add to this one-half cupful each of
chopped carrots, turnips, and celery, one cupful of tomatoes,
a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of chopped or powdered
parsley, bay leaves or thyme, and a slice of bread toasted very
brown. Boil two potatoes for ten minutes, drain, and add them
to the soup. Simmer all till well done, run through a colander,
add hot water to make of proper consistency, a little more salt
if desired, and serve hot.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE SOUP STOCK</h3>

<p>Put into a kettle one quart of tomatoes, three pints of
water, and place over the fire; add one onion, one or two pared
potatoes, and one carrot, all finely chopped, one teaspoonful of
celery salt, two bay leaves, and cook slowly for one hour. Run
through a colander, and add salt to taste. Add to this cooked
macaroni, spaghetti, vermicelli, corn, or rice.</p>


<h3>BARLEY SOUP</h3>

<p>Cook a cupful of pearl barley in three pints of water for
several hours, adding water as needed to keep the quantity
good. When done, add salt and a little cream, or the beaten
yolk of an egg.</p>


<h3>NOODLE SOUP</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks of two eggs thoroughly, then add one cup of
sifted flour, and knead well for five or ten minutes; divide into
four parts, roll each part nearly as thin as a knife blade, and
place on a clean cloth near the fire to dry. When dried sufficiently
so that they will not stick together when rolled up, or
be so dry as to be brittle, roll each piece up into a roll, and
with a sharp knife cut or shave crosswise into very narrow
slices, about one-twelfth of an inch in width. Shake out well,
and let dry thoroughly. Then drop into hot salted water, and
boil twenty minutes; drain off the water well, add a quart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
milk, salt to taste, reheat, and serve. Noodles may be added
to other soups instead of macaroni.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS SOUP</h3>

<p>Take two bundles of fresh, tender asparagus, wash, cut into
short lengths, and put to cook in a quart of hot water. Let
cook slowly till tender, and the water reduced one-half; rub
through a colander, add three cups of milk, a spoonful or two
of cream, and salt to taste. Let heat to boiling, and serve with
croutons. A half cup of well-cooked rice may be stirred into
the soup before serving if desired.</p>


<h3>FOUNDATION FOR CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS</h3>

<p>Rub one tablespoonful each of butter and flour to a cream,
then slowly pour into it one quart of boiling milk, stirring well.
Allow to thicken, add salt to taste, and the seasoning and
ingredients, as canned corn, peas, celery, asparagus, salsify, etc.,
desired for the soup. To make the soup richer, a beaten egg,
or a few spoonfuls of cream may be put into the tureen before
turning in the soup.</p>


<h3>CROUTONS FOR SOUP</h3>

<p>Cut bread into small cubes from one-half inch to an inch
square, and brown in a moderate oven. A spoonful or two of
the croutons may be placed in each plate, and the hot soup
turned over them, or placed in a dish on the table for use as
desired.</p>


<h3>BROWNED FLOUR FOR SOUPS</h3>

<p>Spread a small quantity of flour on shallow tins, and brown
lightly in a moderately hot oven; stir often enough to prevent
any part from scorching. A quantity may be prepared and put
away in covered jars for use.</p>


<h3>SEASONING FOR SOUPS</h3>

<p>Ground nuts with herbs, dried and powdered nicely, flavor
and enrich vegetable soups, gravies, and sauces.</p>


<h3>HERBS FOR SOUPS</h3>

<p>Herbs, such as bay leaves, parsley, thyme, etc., are valuable
for flavoring soups, savories, and gravies. They can be obtained
at a druggists, and a few cents’ worth will last a long time.</p></blockquote>

<p>No one should adopt an impoverished diet.</p>

<p>Bring me my breakfast—oatmeal and boiled eggs.—<i>A. T.
Stewart, the millionaire.</i></p>

<p>Carlyle, catching a glimpse of Macaulay’s face, once remarked,
“Well, any one can see that you are an honest, good
sort of a fellow, made out of oatmeal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, who entertained a great dislike for the Scots,
and lost no opportunity of saying bitter things against them,
once defined oats as “in Scotland food for Scotchmen; but in
England, food for horses.” He was well answered by the indignant
Scotchman, who replied, “Yes, and where can you find
such men as in Scotland, or such horses as in England?”</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Most</span> grains require prolonged cooking, and slow
cooking is preferable to fast. They are frequently
served in the form of mush, and too often in an underdone
state. Thorough cooking not only breaks up the
food, but partially digests the starch contained in it.</p>

<p>Salt should be added to the water before stirring in the
grain or meal.</p>

<p>All grains and meals should be put into actively boiling
water to prevent them from having a raw taste, and
allowed to boil fast until they “set,” or thicken, and cease
sinking to the bottom; till then they should be stirred frequently,
but gently, to prevent burning. After the grain has
thickened, it should be stirred very little, or none at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Enough grain or meal should be used to make the
mush quite thick and glutinous when done. Watery or
sloppy mush is neither palatable nor strengthening to the
digestive organs when used constantly. In fact, it should
not be considered necessary to have mush every morning.
A change occasionally to drier foods
is better for the digestion.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Double Boiler</div>
</div>

<p>An excellent utensil for cooking
grains is a milk or mush boiler,
generally called a double boiler.
This consists of one vessel set inside
of another, the inner one containing
the grain to be cooked, the other
partly filled with boiling water. An
ordinary saucepan, however, will do very well, if smooth,
and by greasing the inside with a little butter before putting
in the water, the tendency of the grain to adhere to the
saucepan will be greatly obviated.</p>

<p>If a double boiler is used, allow the grain to boil in
the inner vessel standing directly over the range until it
“sets,” then cover and place in the outer vessel, the water
in which must also be boiling in order that the cooking
process be not checked; then leave to cook slowly until done.
From three to four hours is not too long when the double
boiler is used. Grain prepared in this way may be cooked
on the previous day and simply warmed up again the next
morning for breakfast. What is left over from any meal
may be used in the next preparation.</p>

<p>If a hastily prepared mush is required, perhaps nothing
better than the rolled oats can be employed, these requiring
not more than half an hour’s cooking, as they are already
partially cooked in their manufacture; but even these are
improved by longer cooking in a double boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>It is very important, when making any kind of mush,
that the water be boiling rapidly, and kept thus while stirring
in the meal; for unless the grain or meal is thoroughly
scalded when stirred in, not even prolonged cooking will
take away the raw taste.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg" alt="three leaves separator" /></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>OATMEAL MUSH</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Quart
Measure</div>
</div>

<p>To a quart of boiling water add a pinch of salt,
sprinkle in a cupful of oatmeal, and boil rapidly
for about ten minutes, or until it sets, stirring
frequently with a fork. Then place over the hot
water in the lower boiler and cook from one to
three hours. Just before serving, remove the
cover and stir lightly with a fork to allow the
steam to escape. This makes the mush more dry.
Serve with baked apples, cream, fresh fruit, or
with the juice from stewed fruit. Oatmeal is
richer in nitrogen than any other grain, and therefore very
nutritious. But to be wholesome it must be well cooked, and
not served in a pasty, undone mass.</p>

<h3>ROLLED OATS</h3>

<p>This is much preferred by some, as it requires only a short
time to cook. Make as above, only using two cupfuls of the
meal to one quart of water. An ordinary saucepan does very
well for this, but the double boiler is better.</p>


<h3>ROLLED OATS AND SAGO MUSH</h3>

<p>Wash and soak one-third cup of sago in a little cold water.
Stir one and one-half cups of rolled oats into one quart of
salted, boiling water. Cook for fifteen minutes, then stir in the
sago, and cook as much longer. Serve with cream, stewed fruit,
or fruit juice.</p>


<h3>GRAHAM MUSH</h3>

<p>Into three pints of rapidly boiling water, properly salted, stir
dry, one heaping pint of sifted Graham flour. Cook slowly for
one hour on the back of the range, stirring but little after the
first few minutes. Serve with milk or cream, and a very little
sugar if desired.</p>


<h3>GRAHAM MUSH WITH DATES</h3>

<p>Cook as above. Take a cupful of dates, cut in two, removing
the stones, and stir into the mush just before taking from the
fire. Serve with milk or cream. Steamed raisins or stewed figs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
may be used instead of dates. Serve hot, or pour out into cups
or molds, first wet with cold water, and serve cold with cream.</p>


<h3>BOILED RICE</h3>

<p>Wash one cup of rice, and put to cook in four cups of boiling
water, slightly salted. Cook quite rapidly for the first fifteen
minutes, stirring a little occasionally to prevent sticking to the
pan. Then cover closely, and cook slowly on the back of the
range without stirring. When nearly done, add a cup of sweet
milk, cook until tender, and serve with milk, cream, or stewed
fruit. If the rice has been soaked overnight, put to cook in an
equal quantity of boiling water, or equal parts of milk and
water, and cook for about half an hour.</p>


<h3>CREAM OF WHEAT</h3>

<p>To four parts of boiling water previously salted, add one
part cream of wheat, sprinkling it in with the hand, and cook
slowly for about an hour. Serve hot with cream or stewed figs.</p>


<h3>CORN-MEAL MUSH, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Into three pints of boiling water, salted, sprinkle one pint
of corn-meal. Cook slowly for an hour, stirring occasionally.
Serve with plenty of milk or cream. Very good and nutritious,
especially for winter.</p>


<h3>CORN-MEAL MUSH, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Put to boil one quart of water, adding one teaspoonful of
salt. Mix smooth one tablespoonful of flour and two cupfuls
each of milk and corn-meal. Stir this gradually into the rapidly
boiling water; boil about half an hour, stirring frequently.
Serve as soon as done, with rich milk.</p>


<h3>CORN-MEAL SQUARES</h3>

<p>Take cold, left-over corn-meal mush, cut into rather thick
slices, and then into inch squares. Put the squares into a
tureen, and pour over them some hot milk or cream. Cover
the dish, let stand a few minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3>BARLEY MUSH</h3>

<p>To each cupful of pearl barley, previously washed, add five
cups of boiling water, a teaspoonful of salt, and cook in a double
boiler for three or four hours. Serve with cream, lemon sauce,
or stewed fruit.</p>


<h3>BOILED WHEAT</h3>

<p>To one part of good, plump wheat add five parts of cold
water, a little salt, and cook slowly from four to six hours, or
until the grains burst open and are tender. If soaked overnight,
less time for boiling will be required. Add a little more water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
while cooking if necessary, but avoid much stirring. Serve hot
or cold with milk, cream, fruit, or fruit juice. A very simple
and wholesome dish.</p>


<h3>GLUTEN MUSH</h3>

<p>Into three pints of rapidly boiling, salted water stir one pint
of gluten; cook in a double boiler for several hours.</p>


<h3>HOMINY</h3>

<p>Soak, then put to cook in enough boiling water to cover.
Cook gently for several hours, being careful not to stir after the
grains begin to soften. Add a little more water if needed.
Season with salt when done. A quantity may be cooked at a
time, and warmed up with a little cream or butter as needed.</p>


<h3>CRACKED WHEAT</h3>

<p>Cook the same as hominy and oatmeal, using three parts of
boiling water to one of cracked wheat. When done, turn into
cups or molds first wet with cold water. Nice served cold with
cream. Seedless raisins may be cooked with it.</p>


<h3>GRANULATED WHEAT</h3>

<p>Use the same proportion and cook the same as cracked
wheat. Serve warm or cold with good sweet cream.</p>


<h3>CORN-MEAL CUTLETS</h3>

<p>Cut cold corn-meal mush into slices three inches long and
one inch wide; roll each piece in beaten egg, slightly salted,
then in grated bread crumbs; place on an oiled tin in the oven
till nicely browned. Other mushes may be treated likewise.</p>


<h3>BROWNED RICE</h3>

<p>Place a small quantity on shallow tins, and brown in the
oven till a golden yellow, stirring frequently so that it may
brown evenly; then steam for about an hour in a steamer over
boiling water or in a steam cooker, allowing two parts of hot
water to one part of rice. When done, it should be quite dry
and mealy. It may be eaten dry, or served with brown or lentil
sauce, or rich milk or cream.</p>


<h3>BAKED MUSH</h3>

<p>Cook any of the foregoing mushes as directed, and as soon
as done, turn into a pan, crock, or a round tin can, first wet
with cold water, or oiled, to prevent sticking. If brushed over
the top with oil, a crust will not form. When cold, cut into
slices from one half to three fourths of an inch thick, place on
oiled tins, and bake till a nice brown. A quart of cooked mush
will make about a dozen slices.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Toast</span> makes a very nice breakfast dish, and is easily
and quickly prepared. It can be made in a variety
of ways which are both simple and wholesome. When
properly prepared, it furnishes abundant nourishment, and
is easily digested.</p>

<p>The proper foundation for all toasts is zwieback (pronounced
zwībäck), or twice-baked bread. This may be made
from either fresh or stale bread, the fresh making the more
crisp and delicious for dry eating. The bread should be light
and of good quality. That which is sour, heavy, and unfit
to eat untoasted, should never be used for toast.</p>

<p>Toasts afford an excellent opportunity for using up left-over
slices of bread, and its use is therefore a matter of
economy as well as of securing variety in diet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg" alt="three leaves separator" /></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>ZWIEBACK, OR DRY TOAST</h3>

<p>Cut fresh or stale light bread, either white or brown, into
slices half an inch thick, place on tins, and bake slowly in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
moderate oven until browned evenly throughout. Care should
be taken not to scorch the bread. It should not be put into an
oven that is merely warm. It should be baked, not simply dried.
The common method of toasting merely the outside of the
bread by holding it over a fire is not the most wholesome way
of preparing toast. When properly made, it will be crisp
throughout. Zwieback may be prepared in quantity and kept
on hand for use. It furnishes a good article of diet, especially
for dyspeptics, eaten dry, or with milk or cream.</p>


<h3>MILK TOAST</h3>

<p>Scald one cupful of milk in double boiler, then add one teaspoonful
of cornstarch, mixed with a little cold water; stir until
it thickens. Cook about ten minutes, then add one teaspoonful
of butter, one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, and pour it over six
slices of zwieback, previously moistened with hot water or milk.</p>


<h3>TOAST WITH CREAM SAUCE</h3>

<p>Prepare a cream sauce as directed on <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>. Moisten five
or six slices of zwieback by dipping them quickly into hot
water or milk, place them on a dish, and pour over the hot
cream sauce.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS TOAST</h3>

<p>Prepare asparagus by washing each stalk free from sand;
remove the tough portions, cut the stalks into small pieces, and
stew in a little hot, salted water; drain off the water as soon as
done, add a cup of milk, and season with a little butter and salt.
Cream may be used instead of the milk and butter. Moisten the
zwieback with hot milk, and place in a dish. Pour over the
stewed asparagus, and serve hot.</p>


<h3>BERRY TOAST</h3>

<p>Prepare zwieback as above. Take fresh or canned strawberries,
raspberries, mulberries, or other fruit, mash well with a
spoon, add sugar to sweeten, and serve as a dressing on the
slices of zwieback previously moistened.</p>


<h3>EGG TOAST</h3>

<p>Moisten slices of zwieback in hot milk or cream, season with
a sprinkle of salt, and serve hot with a poached egg on each
slice. For poached eggs see <a href="#Page_66">page 66</a>.</p>


<h3>BANANA TOAST</h3>

<p>Moisten slices of zwieback in hot milk. Mash the bananas
into a pulp, or cut into thin slices, and place some on each slice
of toast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>


<h3>FRUIT TOAST</h3>

<p>Take stewed apricots, peaches, or plums, rub through a colander,
heat to boiling, thicken with a little cornstarch, sweeten
to taste, and pour over the moistened zwieback.</p>


<h3>CREAM TOAST</h3>

<p>Moisten slices of zwieback in hot water, sprinkle with a little
salt, and dip over each slice a spoonful or two of nice, sweet,
cold cream.</p>


<h3>BUTTER TOAST</h3>

<p>Place each slice of zwieback on a small plate, pour over a
little hot water, and quickly drain off; add a sprinkle of salt, if
desired, spread lightly with butter and serve.</p>


<h3>CRUSHED TOAST</h3>

<p>Take fresh, but thoroughly toasted bread or crackers, or some
of each, grind closely in a coffee or hand mill, or crush with a
rolling-pin, and serve in small dishes with milk, cream, or fruit
juice. This may be served as a substitute for the health food
known as granola. Crushed toast is also a very serviceable
article for use in soups and puddings.</p>


<h3>TOMATO TOAST</h3>

<p>Moisten slices of zwieback in hot milk, and serve with a
dressing prepared by heating a pint of strained, stewed tomatoes
to boiling, and thickening with a tablespoonful of flour or cornstarch
rubbed smooth in a little cold water. Season with salt
and a little cream or butter, and pour over the toast.</p>


<h3>BEAN PASTE</h3>

<p>Soak one cupful of white beans overnight in cold water; put
to cook in the morning in boiling water, and cook to a pulp,
and till the water is quite absorbed. Rub through a colander,
then add a tablespoonful of finely minced onion, one teaspoonful
of powdered sage, one saltspoonful of celery salt, the juice
of one lemon, two or three spoonfuls of tomato juice, if at hand,
and salt to taste. Simmer together for a short time, then use
cold to spread on toast or bread as a relish, or in the place of
butter, or for making sandwiches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Variety.</span>—Remember, as Home Note says,
that “variety of diet is important. Ill health often follows a
monotonous sameness of diet. Oatmeal, bread and butter, and marmalade,
are all excellent breakfast dishes of their kind, but when given every
morning, for years at a time, they become positively nauseating.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Bread</span> stands at the head of all foods. It has very
properly been termed “the staff of life.”</p>

<p>Why this is so is because wheat, from which bread is
mostly made, contains more nearly than any other one
article, all the necessary food elements required to sustain
the human system, and these, too, in proper proportions,
and so forms most nearly a perfect food. From it the
brain, bones, muscles, and nerves, all receive a large amount
of nourishment.</p>

<p>This being so, bread should enter largely into the daily
bill of fare of every family. It is hardly too much to say
that no meal is complete without it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>Where little bread is used, serious defects may frequently
be observed. For instance, in some of the islands of the
Pacific Ocean, where no wheat has been grown, and little
could be obtained, the inhabitants almost universally have
poor teeth. The early decay of the teeth so prevalent among
the rising generation to-day, may generally be attributed to
four causes: (1) A lack of sufficient lime in the water;
(2) too free indulgence in sweets, such as rich cakes, jams,
and candies; (3) too large an amount of flesh foods; and
(4) an insufficient supply of good, simple, wholesome bread,
especially whole wheat bread.</p>

<p>Home-made bread, when properly prepared, is generally
to be preferred to bakers’ bread. Chemicals and adulterations,
as well as a lack of cleanliness and proper care in
preparation, not infrequently characterize the latter, and
thus give rise to serious stomach disorders. Moreover,
bakers’ bread is not always obtainable, and is always necessarily
more expensive than that which is home-made.
The baker can not afford to work for nothing. For these
reasons, every woman, and especially every wife and mother,
ought to know how to make good bread. The temptation
to patronize the bake shop should not outweigh the interests
of the health of the family, and the duty to practise
economy.</p>

<p>The essentials to good bread-making are three:—</p>


<ul><li>1. Good flour.</li>
<li>2. Good yeast.</li>
<li>3. Proper attention.</li>
</ul>


<p>When either of these is lacking, good results can not
be obtained. Poor flour will not produce good bread; good
flour and poor yeast will not make good bread; and good
flour and good yeast with improper attention will not insure
good bread. All three are essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>The first thing to consider in the making of bread is the
flour. Good flour will generally be found to have a creamy
white tint. That which is of a bluish white is seldom the
best. Good flour will fall light and elastic from the hand.
Flour that retains the imprint of the fingers when squeezed,
and falls in a damp, clammy mass, should be avoided.</p>

<p>The second essential is good yeast. One may have ever
so good flour and yet make poor bread, if the flour is used
in conjunction with poor yeast. Good yeast has a fresh,
pungent odor, and is light and foamy; while poor yeast has
a sour odor, and a dull, watery appearance.</p>

<p>The third essential is proper attention. In winter, bread
sponge should be made at night if it is desired to have the
bread baked in the early part of the day. The flour used in
making the sponge should first be warmed, and the sponge
covered with several thicknesses of cloth, and set in a warm
place till morning.</p>

<p>In hot weather set the sponge early in the morning, and
the bread can be baked by noon. Both the sponge and
dough are best kept in an earthen crock or jar, as they are
less quickly affected by drafts of air.</p>

<p>As soon as the sponge has risen to be light and puffy, it
should receive attention immediately, if desired to have the
bread white and sweet. If allowed to reach the point of
running over, or falling in the center, it has stood too long.
For this reason sponge set at night should be mixed late in
the evening, and attended to as early in the morning as
possible.</p>

<p>In using very active yeast, it will not be necessary to
set a sponge. Mix the ingredients into a good bread dough
at the first mixing, beating the batter well while stirring in
the flour. The more thoroughly the batter is beaten, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
less kneading the dough will require. Set the bread in this
way in the morning, and it can be baked by noon.</p>

<p>A few mealy potatoes, cooked and mashed, added to the
sponge, makes the bread sweeter and keeps it fresh longer.
Milk used in connection with yeast should first be scalded
and cooled to lukewarm.</p>

<p>Too much flour should not be used in mixing, as it will
make the bread hard and tough; but enough should be used
to make the dough firm and elastic. Turn the dough out
on the molding-board and knead it, not with the tips of the
fingers, but with the whole hands, from the sides into the
center, turning frequently, that all portions may be thoroughly
worked. When the dough is smooth and elastic,
with no dry flour left on its surface, form into a smooth ball,
and place back in the crock, which should be washed clean,
dried and oiled, to prevent the dough from sticking. Observe
how full it makes the crock; cover up warmly, and
when it has doubled its bulk, form gently into loaves,
handling the dough as little as possible, and place in the
pans for the last rising. When the loaves are risen to twice
their size, place in a moderately hot oven to bake. The
oven should be hot when the bread is put in. By no means
have the bread, when ready to bake, wait for the oven to
be heated, as it may then become too light, run over in the
oven, and possibly be sour.</p>

<p>When nearly ready to bake, test the oven by putting in
it a piece of writing-paper; if it turns dark brown in six
minutes, the oven is of about the proper heat. If bread
bakes too fast, a crust is formed on the outside of the loaf
which prevents the inside from becoming hot enough to
dry thoroughly, and the result is that the inside of the
loaf is too moist, while the outside is baked hard. Bread
should not brown much under fifteen or twenty minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
after being placed in the oven. If it rises much after being
put in the oven, the heat is not sufficient. Bread should be
turned around in the oven if it does not rise or brown evenly.</p>

<p>Medium-sized loaves should be baked from fifty to sixty
minutes; small French loaves about thirty-five minutes.
Bread is done when it shrinks from the pan, and can be
handled without burning the fingers.</p>

<p>When taken from the oven, the loaves should be turned
out of the pans, placed on their sides, so that the crust will
not soften by the steam, and covered with a thin cloth.
When cold, keep in a covered stone jar or a tin box, which
should be kept free from crumbs and musty pieces of bread,
and scalded and dried thoroughly every few days.</p>

<p>As to their healthfulness, the most wholesome breads
are unleavened breads, or those made without either yeast,
baking-powder, soda, or cream of tartar, such as gems,
rolls, and crackers. Next come those made with good
yeast; then those with baking-powder, if comparatively
pure; and lastly those made with soda and sour milk, or
soda and cream of tartar. Baking-powder is preferable to
soda. The latter should seldom if ever be used, as it is injurious
to the health, being an active dyspepsia-producing article.</p>

<h3>WHITE BREAD</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Flour Sieve</div>
</div>

<p>Scald a quart of new or unskimmed milk,
let cool to lukewarm, then stir in a dissolved
yeast cake, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and enough
sifted flour to make a thin batter. Cover, and
set aside till light, then work in flour until a
dough of the proper consistency for bread is
formed. Knead until it is smooth and elastic,
and does not stick to the hands or board. Place
in a clean, oiled crock, and when light, form
into four loaves; let rise again and bake. Equal
parts of milk and water may be used if desired.</p>


<h3>MOTHER’S BREAD</h3>


<p>In the evening boil three small potatoes, or save them out
when cooking, and mash them with a fork in a gallon crock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Put in about three cupfuls of flour, two tablespoonfuls each of
salt and sugar, then pour in enough boiling water to make a
good batter. Beat until smooth. Soak one cake of compressed
yeast or yeast foam in one-half cup of lukewarm water, and
when the batter is just warm stir in the yeast and beat until
quite foamy. Set in a warm place overnight. The first thing
in the morning dip about two quarts of flour in a pan, make a
cavity in the center, and pour in the sponge and about a pint of
warm water. Stir all together into a thin batter, and set in a
warm place till after breakfast; then knead until it does not
stick to the board, put it in a three-gallon crock, well oiled to
prevent the dough from sticking; cover with a tin lid to keep
a crust from forming over the top, then with several thicknesses
of cloth, and set in a warm place until it rises up full. Then
mold into loaves, place in pans, let rise again, and bake in a
moderate oven for about an hour, or until
the loaves shrink from the sides of the pans
and do not burn the fingers when removing
from the pans. Turn the bread out of the
pans, and cover with a thin cloth. This
will make six loaves. If the loaves are
brushed over with cold water just before
being placed in the oven the crust will be more crisp.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_026.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Baking Pan</div>
</div>


<h3>GRAHAM BREAD, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Take two tablespoonfuls of good liquid yeast, two cups of
sweet milk, previously scalded and cooled to lukewarm, one teaspoonful
of salt, and two cupfuls of white flour; beat together
thoroughly, and set to rise. When very light, add three heaping
cupfuls of sifted Graham flour, or sufficient to make a soft
dough. Knead for a half-hour, then place in a pan slightly buttered,
cover warmly, and set to rise. When light, form into
loaves, let rise again, and bake.</p>


<h3>GRAHAM BREAD, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Make a sponge as for white bread. When light, add the
stiffly beaten white of one egg, one tablespoonful each of
sugar and melted butter, and enough sifted Graham flour to
make a soft dough. Knead lightly, place back in oiled crock
till light, then make into loaves, let rise, and bake. Graham
bread should not be mixed as stiff as white bread, or it will be
too solid. Two tablespoonfuls of molasses may be used for
sweetening instead of sugar, if preferred.</p>


<h3>GRAHAM FRUIT BREAD</h3>

<p>Make the same as Graham bread, and when ready to form
into loaves, add a cupful of raisins or dried currants, washed
and dried, and dusted with flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>


<h3>WHOLE WHEAT BREAD</h3>

<p>Make a sponge as for white bread. If desired a light color,
use one fourth white flour instead of all whole wheat flour.
Knead well, keeping the dough soft, then set in a warm place
to rise. When light, form into loaves, let rise again, and bake.
This bread rises slower than white bread.</p>


<h3>BOSTON BROWN BREAD</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Pint
Measure</div></div>

<p>Scald one pint of corn-meal with a pint of boiling
water; let cool till lukewarm, then stir in one
dissolved yeast cake, or one-half cup of sweet, lively
yeast, three tablespoonfuls of molasses, one teaspoonful
of salt, and about three cupfuls of rye
meal. Beat well, put in oiled pan, steam four or
five hours, then place in the oven for half an hour
to form a crust.</p>


<h3>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS</h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of lukewarm milk, previously scalded, three
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, or vegetable oil, one well-beaten
egg, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, a pinch of salt, and one cake
of yeast dissolved in a little of the milk; mix all together, then
add enough flour to make a good batter. Let rise until light,
knead, using sufficient flour; let rise again till very light, roll
out to one-half inch in thickness, cut into round or oval shapes
with a cutter, fold one third back over the top, and place in a
pan to rise. When very light, bake in a moderate oven. Brush
over with beaten yolk of egg, mixed with two spoonfuls of cold
water just before taking from the oven. Braided or plaited rolls
may be made by cutting the rolled dough into strips six inches
long and one inch wide, pinching the ends of each three strips
together, and then braiding.</p>


<h3>CORN-MEAL BREAD</h3>

<p>Stir one-half cup of corn-meal into two cupfuls of boiling
water; when well cooked, remove from the fire and add two cupfuls
of cold water; stir well together; then add one teaspoonful
of salt, one cake of yeast dissolved in a little warm water, two
tablespoonfuls of sugar or molasses, and enough white flour
to make a good dough. Knead well, and set to rise; when light,
form into three loaves, let rise again, and bake for nearly an
hour.</p>


<h3>SALT-RISING BREAD</h3>

<p>Take a small pitcher and put into it a half pint of warm
water, a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, then stir in flour
enough to make a medium-thick batter. Set the pitcher in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
kettle of warm water to rise. It should be kept warm all the
time, not hot, for if it is scalded, it will never rise. When light,
stir in a pint of warm milk or water and enough warm flour
to make a soft dough. Knead it, form into a loaf, place in the
pan, set to rise in a warm place, and bake as soon as light.</p>


<h3>RAISED BISCUITS</h3>

<p>Make from dough prepared for white bread. When the
dough is ready to form into loaves, divide it into small, equal
portions, shape into smooth, round biscuits, place closely in a
shallow baking pan, and let rise till considerably lighter than
bread; brush lightly with milk, and bake in a rather quick oven.</p>


<h3>GEMS<br />

General Directions</h3>

<p>Beating in an abundance of cold air is very essential in the
making of good gems, as it is this that makes them light. Cold
air is preferable to warm air, as it expands
more when heating.</p>


<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Gem Irons</div>
</div>
<p>Gems are also better when baked in
iron pans than in tin, as the iron retains
the heat better, and bakes the
gems more evenly. The irons should
be heated and oiled before the batter is dropped into them.</p>

<p>Having the oven hot from the first is also essential, as a crust
will then be formed immediately, and the air which has been
beaten into the batter will thus be prevented from escaping.
They should be placed in the oven so as to bake on the top
first, and afterward on the bottom. These points should be
carefully observed. Gems are best served hot. They should be
broken open, and never cut with a knife, as this makes them
heavy.</p>


<h4>GRAHAM GEMS, NO. 1</h4>

<p>Place the gem irons in the oven or on the range to heat.
Mix salted Graham flour with cold milk or water to a batter
thick enough to drop, beating vigorously for ten minutes to
beat in the air. Butter the gem irons, and fill each cup nearly
full of the batter. Put in a hot oven, and bake until done.</p>


<h4>GRAHAM GEMS, NO. 2</h4>

<p>Beat separately the yolk and white of an egg. Add to the
beaten yolk two cupfuls of sweet, rich milk, one-half teaspoonful
of salt, and stir well together; then sift in one and one-half
cups of Graham flour, and a scant cup of white flour, beating
vigorously meanwhile. Continue to beat until the mixture is
light and foamy throughout, and full of air bubbles; then stir
in gently the stiffly beaten white of the egg. Have the gem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
irons thoroughly heated, slightly butter them, drop in the batter
with a spoon, and bake in a quick oven.</p>


<h4>OATMEAL GEMS</h4>

<p>Beat separately the yolk and white of an egg. To the beaten
yolk add a cupful of well-cooked oatmeal mush, and a half cup
of milk or thin cream. Beat together thoroughly. Continue to
beat while adding a cupful of white flour and a pinch of salt,
then fold in lightly the stiffly beaten white of the egg. Have
the gem irons heated hot, slightly butter, drop in the batter,
filling the little cups nearly full, and bake in a quick oven until
a light brown.</p>


<h4>CORN-MEAL GEMS</h4>

<p>Stir well together one and one-half cupfuls of milk, and the
yolks of two eggs previously beaten. To this add two cupfuls
of corn-meal, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and one cupful of
white flour. Beat thoroughly, then stir in lightly the whites of
the eggs previously beaten to a stiff froth, and bake as above.</p>


<h4>GRANULATED WHEAT GEMS</h4>

<p>Mix together one cupful each of cold water and milk, and
one-half teaspoonful of salt. Then add gradually two and one-half
cupfuls of fine granulated wheat, beating continuously.
Beat vigorously for ten minutes, then drop by spoonfuls into
thoroughly heated, buttered gem irons, beating the batter
briskly several times while dipping it in. Bake at once in a
very hot oven.</p>


<h3>RICE CAKES</h3>

<p>Moisten one cup of well-cooked rice with two tablespoonfuls
of cream or rich milk; add one tablespoonful of sugar, and mix
in enough flour to make it hold together. Form into cakes one-third
of an inch thick, and bake in a hot oven. When done,
split open, and serve with maple or lemon sirup. To make
lemon sirup, see <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>.</p>


<h3>BREAKFAST ROLLS</h3>

<p>To three slightly heaping cups of sifted Graham flour add a
little salt, and one cup of milk or thin cream; cream is better.
Stir the milk or cream into the flour, mixing it well with the
flour as fast as poured in. Knead thoroughly, then divide the
dough into three portions, and with the hands roll each portion
over and over on the molding-board until a long roll from an
inch to an inch and a half in thickness is formed. Cut into two-
or three-inch lengths, and bake at once in a hot oven, in a
baking pan dusted with flour, or better, on a perforated piece
of sheet-iron made for the purpose, placing the rolls a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
distance apart. Bake until a light brown. When done, do not
place one on top of another.</p>

<p>Flour kneaded into cold Graham flour, oatmeal, or corn-meal
mush makes very good breakfast rolls.</p>


<h3>STICKS</h3>

<p>Make the same as breakfast rolls, only rolling the dough to
about the size of the little finger, and cutting into three- or
four-inch lengths.</p>


<h3>FRENCH ROLLS</h3>

<p>Make a sponge at night of one-half cake of dry or one-half
cup of good liquid yeast, the beaten white of one egg, two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a
little salt, and three cups of warm milk or water, and flour
sufficient to make a soft dough. In the morning knead well
and let rise again. When light, roll out the dough to about
three fourths of an inch in thickness; cut into about four-inch
squares with a sharp knife, butter the edges, and roll each
corner up and over to the center; place on buttered tins, allow
the rolls to become very light, and bake in a moderately hot
oven. The sponge for this can be set in the morning if the
yeast is very quick.</p>


<h3>TO GLAZE ROLLS</h3>

<p>When ready to bake, brush the rolls or biscuit lightly with
milk; or, when nearly baked, brush with the yolk of an egg to
which has been added two spoonfuls of cold water and half a
teaspoonful of sugar. Return to oven till done.</p>


<h3>MARYLAND OR BEATEN BISCUIT</h3>

<p>Mix five cupfuls of white flour, one-half cupful of vegetable
oil or butter, and one teaspoonful of salt to a very stiff dough
with one cupful of cold water. Knead for twenty minutes, using
no more flour for the molding-board; then beat hard with a
wooden mallet or hammer for twenty minutes longer, until the
dough is flat and of even thickness throughout; sprinkle over a
little flour, fold half of the dough back evenly over the other
half, and beat quickly around the edges, to keep in the air.
Continue beating until the dough is brittle, and will snap if a
piece is broken off quickly. Pinch off into pieces the size of a
small walnut, work smooth, flatten on top with the thumb,
prick with a fork, place on perforated tins a little distance apart,
and bake in a moderate oven for nearly an hour, or until dry
and brittle throughout.</p>


<h3>WHOLE WHEAT CRISPS</h3>

<p>Take one cupful of rich cream, two tablespoonfuls of sugar,
a pinch of salt, two cupfuls, or enough to make a stiff dough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of fine granulated, whole wheat flour. Beat well, and knead for
fifteen minutes, first with a spoon, until the batter becomes too
thick, and then with the hands. Roll out as thin as wafers, cut
into shapes with a biscuit cutter, and bake on floured tins in a
very hot oven.</p>


<h3>GRAHAM WAFERS</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Cake
Cutter</div>
</div>
<p>Stir together one cupful each of sifted Graham
flour and white flour, one tablespoonful each of butter
and sugar, and a saltspoonful of salt; then mix
with enough cold water to make a stiff dough. Roll
out very thin, cut into small squares, or with a cake
cutter, and bake on tins in a quick oven.</p>


<h3>FRUIT BISCUIT</h3>

<p>Make a dough with one cupful of cold, sweet cream or rich
milk, three cupfuls of sifted Graham or white flour, and a little
salt. Knead thoroughly, and divide into two portions. Roll
each quite thin, then spread one with currants, stoned dates,
figs, or seedless raisins, chopped fine, and place the other one
on top; press down with the rolling-pin, cut into oblong squares
with a knife, and bake.</p>


<h3>CRESCENTS</h3>

<p>Make a dough, using the recipe for White Bread. When
ready to form into loaves, work into it two tablespoonfuls each
of butter and sugar; roll out into a sheet half an inch thick,
cut into six-inch squares, then divide diagonally, forming triangles;
brush each lightly with water, and roll up, beginning
at the longest side; place on oiled pans, turning the ends toward
each other in the form of a crescent. When very light, brush
with milk, and bake in a quick oven for about twenty minutes.</p>


<h3>RUSKS</h3>

<p>Make a sponge at night with one cupful of sugar, one cupful
of scalded milk, cooled to lukewarm, one-half cupful of butter,
two eggs, one cake of dry or one-half cup of good liquid yeast,
and sufficient flour to make a drop batter. Set in a warm place
to rise. In the morning knead well, and when risen again,
mold into the form of biscuits, place a little distance apart on
buttered tins, and brush over with the beaten white of an egg
sweetened; let stand until light, and bake.</p>


<h3>PLAIN BUNS</h3>

<p>Beat together one-fourth cup of lively yeast, one cup of
sweet milk, previously scalded and cooled to lukewarm, one-half
teaspoonful of salt, two cups of warm flour, and set in a
warm place to rise. When very light, work into the dough
one-half cup of sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Knead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
well for ten minutes, using enough flour to make a soft dough.
Shape into the form of biscuits a little larger than an egg; place
on tins slightly buttered, and set in a warm place to rise.
When very light, bake in a moderately hot oven. The tops
may be brushed over with the sweetened beaten white of an
egg while baking, or sprinkled with moist sugar when taken
from the oven.</p>


<h3>FRUIT BUNS</h3>

<p>Make the same as plain buns, adding one-half cup of raisins
or currants just before kneading and forming into buns.</p>


<h3>RICE WAFFLES</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_032.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Waffle Iron</div>
</div>
<p>Set a sponge at night with two cupfuls of sweet milk, scalded
and cooled to lukewarm, one tablespoonful of butter, a pinch of
salt, two-thirds of a cupful of boiled rice, three
cupfuls of flour, and one-fourth cup of liquid
yeast. Beat the batter hard for five or six minutes,
and set in a warm place to rise. In the
morning add two well-beaten eggs, and stir
well together. Bake on a hot, buttered waffle
iron. If this is not at hand, have the gem irons
well heated, slightly butter to prevent sticking,
and drop in the batter. Place in a hot oven so
the top will bake first, and bake to a rich
brown color. Very nice for breakfast.</p>


<h3>PUFFS</h3>

<p>To two cups of milk add a little salt and the yolks of two
eggs well beaten; then sift in, a little at a time, and beating
meanwhile, three small cups of flour. Beat until light, then stir
in gently the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and bake in hot
gem irons.</p>


<h3>FRUIT LOAF, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Take enough good bread dough for one loaf, add one cupful
of brown sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and one cupful of
raisins, previously washed and dried. Knead well and let rise;
then knead again, and place in a bread pan, let rise until light,
and bake in a moderate oven.</p>


<h3>FRUIT LOAF, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Make a sponge of one and one-half cups of warm milk or
water, one-half cup of good yeast, the beaten white of one egg,
one tablespoonful each of butter and sugar, a little salt, and
flour sufficient to make a soft dough. Let rise till light; then
knead well and let rise again. When light, roll out to about
one inch in thickness, spread over with chopped dates, or raisins,
or currants which have been previously washed and dried;
roll up and form into a loaf, let rise, and bake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>


<h3>COFFEE CAKES</h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of bread dough (made with milk) when
ready for the pans; put into a deep dish and work in four tablespoonfuls
of cocoanut or vegetable oil or butter, four tablespoonfuls
of sugar, the stiffly beaten white of one egg, and
enough flour to make a fairly stiff dough. Knead well, and
roll out into a long strip about nine inches in width, three feet
in length, and one fourth of an inch thick; spread over this
four or five tablespoonfuls of oil or melted butter, omitting
about two inches at the farther end; beginning at end nearest,
roll up like jelly roll; cut into slices an inch thick; place a
little distance apart on tins sprinkled with sugar; set in a warm
place, and when very light, brush over with oil; sprinkle with
a little sugar, and bake. If desired, ground cinnamon or grated
nutmeg may be sprinkled over the dough before rolling it up.</p>


<h3>FLANNEL CAKES</h3>

<p>Heat three cupfuls of milk to boiling; put into a crock one
cupful of corn-meal and two tablespoonfuls of butter, then pour
in the scalding milk; beat well, allow to cool to lukewarm, then
stir in one tablespoonful of sugar, two of flour, one teaspoonful
of salt, and one-half yeast cake dissolved in one-third cup warm
water; beat well, and set to rise overnight. Bake on a hot
griddle.</p>


<h3>CORN-MEAL BATTER CAKES</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Griddle</div>
</div>
<p>To two cups of cold corn-meal mush, add one cup of sifted
flour, and a pinch of salt; beat well the yolks of two eggs, to
which add two-thirds cup of milk, and stir
into the mush; beat thoroughly until light
and smooth, adding a little more milk if necessary,
to make the batter of proper consistency.
Then gently stir in the whites of the
eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and bake in small
cakes on both sides on a griddle, slightly buttered,
or better still on a soapstone griddle, in which case use
no oil nor butter on it. Serve hot.</p>


<h3>BUCKWHEAT PANCAKES</h3>

<p>In the evening take two quarts of warm water, add one-fourth
cup of good yeast, a teaspoonful of salt, and buckwheat
flour enough to make a good batter. If desired, a cupful of
corn-meal or a few spoonfuls of white flour may be used instead
of all buckwheat. Beat well and set to rise. In the morning
thin the batter with a little warm water, if necessary, and bake
on a hot griddle. If cakes are desired for several mornings, the
batter may be kept going by leaving at least a cupful after each
baking, and adding the necessary warm water and buckwheat
flour each evening as at first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>


<h3>LENTIL FRITTERS</h3>

<p>To a pint of lentil soup (left-over soup will do), add the
well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and sift in enough flour, a little
at a time, beating thoroughly, to make a good batter. Then
add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, drop by spoonfuls on
a hot buttered griddle, and brown on both sides.</p>


<h3>CORN FRITTERS</h3>

<p>To each quart of raw sweet corn (a dozen nice ears), grated
from the cob, add the beaten yolks of three eggs, a teaspoonful
of salt, and one and one-half cups of fine bread or cracker
crumbs, or enough to make a batter just stiff enough to drop
from a spoon. Then stir in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs,
and drop with a spoon on a hot, oiled, or soapstone griddle.
Serve hot.</p>


<h3>USES FOR STALE BREAD</h3>

<p>Whole slices of stale bread, if in good condition, may be
steamed or used for toast. Crumbs, crusts, and broken pieces
not suitable for this purpose may be placed in a pan, and put
into a slow oven until thoroughly dried (not browned), then
ground in a mill, or rolled on a breadboard with the rolling-pin,
and put away in covered jars for use. This will be useful
for making corn-meal cutlets or anything that is to be rolled
in crumbs, dipped in egg, and browned.</p>


<h3>POTATO YEAST</h3>

<p>Put to cook six medium-sized potatoes in two quarts of hot
water. Tie a handful of hops in a cloth, and boil with the potatoes
during the last ten minutes. When done, take potatoes and
hops from the water, leaving the water over the fire. Mash the
potatoes fine, and add four tablespoonfuls of flour, and two each
of sugar and salt. Stir well together. Pour over this mixture
the boiling potato water, stirring well that no lumps be formed.
When cooled to lukewarm, stir in a cupful of liquid yeast, or
one cake of dry yeast dissolved in warm water. After fermentation
has ceased, turn into an earthen jar previously scalded,
cover, and set in a cool, dark place. Shake before using.</p>


<h3>HOP YEAST</h3>

<p>Steep a handful of hops in a quart of hot water for five minutes.
Then strain, and turn the boiling water over a cupful
of flour, blended with a little cold water. Add one tablespoonful
of salt, and two of sugar; let cool till lukewarm, then stir
in a half cup of liquid yeast, or one cake of dry or compressed
yeast dissolved in a little warm water. Set aside for twenty-four
hours, stirring occasionally; then bottle and keep as above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">
Fruits</span> are a natural food. They form no inconsiderable
part of those products of the earth given by the
Creator to our first parents as food. “Behold, I have
given you,” he says, “every herb bearing seed, which is
upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for
meat.” Gen. 1:29.</p>

<p>Fruits are not only delightful to the eye, pleasing to
the smell, and satisfying to the taste, but they contain
elements which are necessary for the best maintenance of
the system; hence the natural craving for them when the
system is in a normal condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>While not containing a large amount of nutrition compared
to their size, they are, nevertheless, valuable on
account of their juices, and also because of their giving bulk
to our food,—a very necessary thing to be considered.</p>

<p>Containing as they do from seventy-five to ninety per
cent of water, their use naturally allays thirst. If their
use were more general, there would doubtless be less desire
for unnatural drinks.</p>

<p>As a rule fruits, especially acid and sub-acid fruits, are
cooling to the blood, and most kinds also act as a laxative
to the system, tending to keep it free and open. They
should, therefore, be freely used in the daily bill of fare,
though in proper combinations. Fruits go well with grains
and milk, but not so well with vegetables, especially acid
fruits.</p>

<p>And what gives a nicer appearance to the table than a
dish of fruit! The very sight is inviting and appetizing.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fruit Dish</div>
</div>
<p>In preparing fresh fruit for
the table, care should be taken
to select only that which is
sound and ripe. It should
also be carefully cleaned.
Apples should be wiped with
a damp cloth, and their
beauty will be further enhanced
by polishing them
with a dry one. Plums should
be likewise treated. Grapes
should be washed, and the
stem ends of bananas cut off. Bananas may also be peeled,
sliced, and served with cream. Oranges may be placed on
the table whole, or their skins cut into eighths, and peeled
half-way down. In serving cherries in their natural state,
the stems should be left on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>Much taste may be displayed in the arrangement of
fresh fruits for the table. A few green leaves interspersed
with the fruit, or a variety of fruits tastily arranged on
the same dish, make a very attractive appearance.</p>

<p>Nature sets before us an abundance of delicious fruits,
and these in almost endless varieties and flavors.</p>

<p>Most fruits are both wholesome and agreeable when
eaten raw, but many are rendered more easy of digestion
by cooking. Some persons with weak digestion can not
eat many kinds of raw fruits, but almost every one can eat
most kinds when cooked.</p>

<p>The following are some of the most simple and practical
ways in which fruits may be prepared:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg" alt="three leaves separator" /></div>

<blockquote>
<h3>BAKED APPLES, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Apples to be baked may be cored and pared or baked with
the skins on. If firm and quite tart, pare, place in a pie dish,
add sugar and a little hot water, and bake in a moderate oven.
If the apples are juicy, less water will be required. When
tender, turn into a dish, and pour over them the sirup or juice.</p>


<h3>BAKED APPLES, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Pare and core without halving, a number of nice, tart apples;
fill the centers with sugar and jelly, lay closely in a shallow
pan, add a little water, and bake slowly, basting occasionally
with the sirup to keep the centers well filled. Bake till brown
and tender, and serve with a boiled custard made with two cups
of milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, and vanilla to
flavor.</p>


<h3>STEWED APPLES</h3>

<p>Pare, core, and cut into small pieces some moderately tart
apples, place in a saucepan, and add sufficient boiling water to
stew to a pulp; cook slowly for about an hour, stirring but
little. When cool, add sugar to sweeten.</p>


<h3>BAKED SWEET APPLES</h3>

<p>Select good, sweet apples. Wash, but do not pare or core
them; put into a baking pan with a little water, and bake in a
hot oven. Baste occasionally with the juice in the bottom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the pan. When done, if desired, each apple may be dipped
in the beaten white of an egg, then in powdered sugar, and
returned to the oven until the icing is set. Plain sweet baked
apples are very nice served with cream.</p>


<h3>APPLE SCALLOP</h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice a half dozen good cooking apples.
Spread a layer in the bottom of a deep pudding dish, then over
these a layer of bread crumbs mixed with a little sugar, thus
alternating till the dish is filled, having a layer of apples on
top. Add a half cup of cold water, and bake in a rather quick
oven till done. Serve with rich milk or cream.</p>


<h3>BOILED APPLES</h3>

<p>Remove the cores and cook whole, or in halves, in enough
boiling water to cover them. Cook slowly. When tender, remove
the apples to a dish with a spoon or fork. Sweeten the
juice with sugar, add a little lemon extract, thicken slightly
with a very little cornstarch blended with a little cold water,
and pour over the apples. Serve when cool.</p>


<h3>BAKED PEARS</h3>

<p>Take good, sound pears, cut in halves, pare, and fill an enameled
pudding dish, sprinkling sugar through them; pour in a
cupful of hot water, cover tightly, and bake slowly till tender.
Serve cold. Or wash, wipe, and bake whole in a shallow dish,
putting in a very little water.</p>


<h3>STEWED PEARS</h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and core nice ripe pears, and drop into cold
water to keep from discoloring. Make a sirup, allowing two
cups of water and a half cup of sugar to each quart of fruit.
Boil the sirup for a few minutes, put in the fruit, and cook
until tender and pink in color, being careful not to break the
fruit by stirring. Three or four slices of lemon added to the
sirup while boiling will improve the flavor of the pears. Remove
the lemon before putting in the fruit.</p>


<h3>BAKED QUINCES</h3>

<p>Pare, core, and bake the same as apples. The fruit may be
left whole, and the centers filled with sugar. Sufficient water
should be used so the fruit will not become dry. Baste with
the sirup while baking.</p>


<h3>BAKED PEACHES, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Take good, firm peaches, pare, cut in halves, removing the
stones, and place in a deep pudding dish, sprinkling with sugar.
Add a little water, and bake until tender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>


<h3>BAKED PEACHES, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Bake as above; when done, cover the top with a meringue
made of the whites of two or three eggs beaten stiff and a little
powdered sugar; return to the oven and brown slightly. Serve
cold with cream.</p>


<h3>STEWED PEACHES</h3>

<p>Take ripe peaches, pare, or wipe carefully with a damp cloth;
cut in halves, remove the stones, and drop into cold water.
When ready, place the fruit in a saucepan, adding sufficient
boiling water to keep from burning. Add sugar, two tablespoonfuls
to each quart of fruit. Cook slowly until tender,
generally from twenty to thirty minutes.</p>


<h3>STEWED PRUNES</h3>

<p>Wash the prunes thoroughly in warm water, rinse, then add
water to cover, or about three parts water to one of prunes,
and soak for several hours, or overnight. Put them to cook in
the same water in which they soaked, and stew gently until
tender. When nearly done, add a little sugar if desired. Serve
cold.</p>


<h3>STEWED FRUITS</h3>

<p>Small fruits are better stewed in a double enamel saucepan,
and the larger kind baked in a tightly covered earthen crock
or jar in the oven, with as little water as possible. Dried fruit,
such as figs, prunes, peaches, raisins, dates, etc., should first be
well washed, rinsed, soaked for several hours in enough water
to cover, and afterward cooked in the same water in which they
have soaked.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE</h3>

<p>Pare, cut into thin slices into a dish, and sprinkle lightly
with sugar; let stand in a cool place for an hour, and serve.</p>


<h3>FRUIT MOLD</h3>

<p>Stew a quart of berries in a small quantity of water for fifteen
or twenty minutes; then add sugar to taste, and two tablespoonfuls
of cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water; cook
until thickened, then turn into molds first wet with cold water;
serve cold with milk or cream. Heat fruit juices and treat
similarly.</p>


<h3>BANANAS WITH WHIPPED CREAM</h3>

<p>Remove the peel, cut into thin slices, and sprinkle with a
very little sugar and a few drops of orange juice. Serve in
small dishes, placing a tablespoonful of whipped cream on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
dish. If bananas are slightly scraped after removing the skins,
they will be more readily digested.</p>


<h3>APPLE BUTTER</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Large Spoon</div>
</div>
<p>Pare, quarter, and core about
equal parts of sweet and tart apples.
Boil sweet cider down, about four
gallons into one gallon. Cook the
apples in either sweet cider or water
till soft, then add the boiled cider,
and boil and stir with a wooden spoon
until thick. A little butter and ground cinnamon may be added
for flavoring, and sugar if necessary. Can in jars, or set away
in jars without canning if desired for immediate use.</p>


<h3>LEMON SIRUP</h3>

<p>Boil one cupful of sugar and one-fourth cupful of water
until it slightly thickens; add a small teaspoonful of butter and
a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Serve hot.</p>


<h3>LEMON HONEY</h3>

<p>Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan to warm;
then add one cup of sugar, the juice and grated rind of two
lemons, and two eggs well beaten; cook until thickened, stirring
constantly that no lumps be formed, and, if not cooked
in a double boiler, being careful not to burn. When done,
turn into cups and cover the same as jelly. Nice used as
a filling for layer cake.</p>


<h3>PLUM MARMALADE</h3>

<p>Wash the plums, cut them in halves, removing the stones,
and cook for about fifteen minutes, allowing a scant cup of
water to each quart of fruit. Then rub through a colander, add
one cup of sugar to each quart of pulp, and boil slowly one
hour, stirring often to prevent burning.</p>


<h3>GRAPE MARMALADE</h3>

<p>Make the same as plum marmalade, only allowing half a cup
of water to a quart of fruit for cooking.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE FRUIT JELLY</h3>

<p>Choose a bright, sunny day for making jelly, in order to
have it as firm and clear as possible. Make in small quantities
at a time, using only porcelain or graniteware in preparing fruit
or juice. Small fruits should be used as soon after being
picked as possible, and should not be overripe. Cherries should
be mixed with one fourth their quantity of currants, as they do
not jelly easily. Two parts red raspberry with one part currant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
juice makes a nice-flavored jelly. Place the fruit desired for
the jelly in the saucepan, add only enough water to keep from
burning, and cook until tender or well scalded; then drain
through a strong, coarse, white flannel or cotton bag first
wrung out of hot water. If the bag is made three-cornered,
the weight of the fruit at the large top presses the juice out
more freely at the point. Heat the sugar in the oven, stirring
frequently to prevent burning. About three fourths of a pound
should be used to each pint of juice. To prevent the jelly
glasses from breaking, place them in a pan of cold water and
allow it to come nearly to boiling; or with a cloth rub the
outside of them well with a little butter or oil, and pour in
the juice slowly. A little paraffin poured over the jelly when
cooled, or writing-paper cut to fit the glasses, and oiled, is good
for covering before putting on the covers.</p>


<h4>APPLE JELLY</h4>

<p>Select nice tart, red apples, wash, quarter, and core, but do
not pare; add a small quantity of water, and boil only until soft.
Then strain as directed for making fruit jelly, measure the
juice, return it to a clean saucepan, and boil for ten or fifteen
minutes, skimming thoroughly. Add the heated sugar, three-fourths
pound to each pint of juice. Boil a few minutes, or
until it jellies nicely, then turn into glasses.</p>


<h4>CURRANT JELLY</h4>

<p>Weigh the fruit, and to each pound weigh out half the
weight of granulated sugar. Place a few of the currants in a
granite saucepan, mash with a potato masher to extract enough
juice to keep it from burning, then add the remainder of the
fruit, and boil about twenty minutes, stirring frequently to
prevent burning; strain, return juice to a clean saucepan, let
boil for five minutes, skim, then add the sugar previously
heated. This should jelly at once. Turn into glasses. Make
blackberry and raspberry jelly in the same way.</p>


<h4>QUINCE JELLY</h4>

<p>Wash, wipe, and remove any imperfect spots, quarter and
core, but do not pare the fruit. Cut into small pieces, and place
in the preserving pan, with water enough to half cover. Cook
until tender, stirring frequently. Remove from the fire, and
strain through a jelly-bag, measure the juice, return to a clean
saucepan, let boil fifteen minutes, then add sugar, three-fourths
pound to each pint of juice. Boil until it jellies nicely, removing
the scum, and when done, turn into the jelly cups at once.</p>


<h4>CRANBERRY JELLY</h4>

<p>Pick over and wash one quart of cranberries, and put them
in a granite saucepan with one cupful of boiling water; cook
about ten minutes, or until soft. Then put them through a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
strainer or vegetable press, return the juice to the pan, add two
cupfuls of sugar, place over the fire, and cook about five minutes.
Turn into a mold to cool.</p>


<h3>HOW TO CAN FRUIT<br />

<small>General Remarks</small></h3>

<p>Boiling or canning fruit consists in sealing up in air-tight
bottles, or jars, fruit which has previously been cooked. Many
do not appreciate the value of canning fruit because they have
never tried it. But the process is so simple, and the result so
satisfactory, that those who have ever given it a trial usually
feel well repaid for the effort put forth.</p>

<p>Canning fruit practically lengthens the fruit season until it
is perennial. Fruit, if properly canned, can be preserved, even
for years, in a very natural and wholesome state.</p>

<p>While it is true that in semitropical countries some kind of
fruit can be obtained from the markets at most seasons of the
year, it is both a matter of providence and economy to lay by,
at a time when fruit is cheap and in season, for those times
when it is scarce, high-priced, or unobtainable. A lesson can
here be learned from the bee. During the summer, when the
flowers are in bloom, it culls the sweet, that it may have a store
of honey to eat in the winter hours.</p>

<p>It is very desirable to have the fruit fresh, as picked from
the tree or vine; but many of the nicest and most juicy and
delicately flavored fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, currants,
gooseberries, plums, blueberries, cherries, peaches, and
apricots are in season for only a comparatively short time. It
is, therefore, of value to know how to preserve these for the
unseasonable portions of the year. It is a matter of no little
convenience for the housewife to have these delicious fruits in
her house, ready for use at a moment’s notice. But this can be
the case only by having on hand a supply of canned fruit.</p>

<p>Some may think that this supply of canned fruit can readily
be substituted by the same kinds of fruit put up in jams, marmalades,
etc., and that these can be purchased at reasonable
prices at the stores all ready for use, and the trouble of preserving
fruit one’s self is thereby saved. While this may be
true, the fruit prepared thus is not to be compared to fruit in its
more natural state. The amount of sugar generally used in
making jams and marmalades causes them to be too rich in
saccharine matter, and consequently more liable, if freely used,
to injure the teeth, cause acidity of the stomach, dyspepsia, and
liver trouble, while nearly all, even dyspeptics, can eat simple
stewed fruit of one kind or another without injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>


<h4>Selecting Cans</h4>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Mason Can</div>
</div>
<p>In canning fruit, care should be taken to provide good cans
and perfectly fitting covers. This is a matter of much importance.
The Mason glass cans, or jars, with the
white porcelain-lined covers and white rubber
bands, are, perhaps, the best. It may seem a
little expensive on the start to purchase these,
but there is practically no further expense
connected with them, aside from providing
new rubbers or covers occasionally, as the
jars can be used year after year, or until
broken. Either the pint, quart, or two-quart
jars may be used, as best suits the needs of
the family.</p>

<p>If a Mason can opener is not at hand, the
process of opening the jars may be made
easier by first running the edge of a thin
knife blade around under the rubbers, care
being taken not, by prying or otherwise, to
injure the rubbers or lids.</p>

<p>After the fruit has been used from the jars,
wash and dry them, and set away for future use. The rubbers
and covers may be put into a cloth bag and hung away from
the dust.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>

<p>Select good, sound, fresh fruit, but not overripe, or it will
be mushy and insipid when cooked. The larger fruits should
not be quite as soft for canning as for eating.</p>

<p>Cook in a graniteware or enameled saucepan or preserving
kettle. Iron, tin, copper, or brass should not be used.</p>

<p>Always cook slowly, as rapid boiling breaks up the fruit,
and causes it to lose much of its nice flavor.</p>

<p>Cook thoroughly and evenly, in small quantities, and in as
little water as possible, fruit being better cooked in its own
juice, which soon boils out. The length of time required for
cooking will depend upon the kind and quantity of fruit, hard
and less ripe fruit requiring more time.</p>

<h4>Utensils for Canning Fruit</h4>

<p>Two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar to each quart of fruit
will generally be found sufficient for the milder fruits; the
more tart, such as plums, currants, gooseberries, etc., will require
from six to eight tablespoonfuls.</p>

<p>While the fruit is cooking, immerse two or three jars in a
large pan of scalding (not boiling) water, laying them down
if there is room. If the jars are new, put them in cold water,
and gradually raise the temperature, to prevent them from
breaking. Likewise put the covers in a basin of hot water.
Much depends on keeping everything hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>Have ready an enameled dipper or cup, a cloth for wiping
the outside of the jars, a spoon, fork, and a small pan in which
to set the jars while being filled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Utensils for Canning Fruit</div>
</div>

<p>When the fruit is well cooked, roll one of the jars over in
the hot water, empty it, place it in the small pan, and quickly
fill with the boiling fruit, putting in a little of the juice first.
Fill to overflowing. Skim off all foam or bubbles of air that
come to the top. If any bubbles are seen in the fruit, pass a
fork or spoon handle, first dipped in hot water, down into the
jar, slightly stirring, when they will come to the top, and can
be skimmed off. Wipe the juice from the top of the jar, and
screw down the cover quickly and tightly. See that the rubber
extends beyond the cover all around. Should any part of the
edge of the cover fail to fit down into the rubber tightly after
being screwed on, press down all around with the edge of the
handle of a strong knife. Turn the jars upside down to cool.
If no juice leaks out, the sealing is perfect.</p>

<p>After a few hours turn the jars right side up, and watch for
a few days. If there is any leakage or sign of fermentation,
the work is a failure, and the fruit should be opened at once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a little more sugar added, boiled, and used as soon as possible.
If all is right, store in a cool, dark place for future use. If a
proper place is not convenient, wrap the jars in brown paper
to keep out the light, as this is likely to cause fermentation.</p>

<p>If the foregoing directions are carefully followed, there is
no reason why the work should not be a perfect success.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER METHOD</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Cooking Boiler</div>
</div>
<p>If it is desired to preserve the fruit as nearly whole as possible,
prepare it as for cooking, place it, dry, compactly in the
jars, and screw the covers on
loosely without rubbers. Place the
jars, six or eight at a time, in a
boiler, standing them on thin pieces
of board, and filling the boiler with
sufficient warm water to come up
half way on the jars. Cover
tightly, using a thick cloth, if necessary,
to keep in the steam; place
on the range, and after the water
comes to the boiling-point, cook
for from one-half to one hour, according to kind and ripeness
of fruit. When cooked, remove the jars, taking care not to
allow a draft to strike them, to prevent cracking; allow to settle
a few minutes; remove the covers, and fill with a sirup, boiling
hot, allowing about a cup of sugar to each quart of fruit;
or, if desired to can without sugar, fill the jars with boiling
water. Put on the rubbers, and seal at once, testing by turning
bottom side up.</p>

<p>This method should be employed in canning vegetables.
Only perfectly fresh vegetables should be used for canning.</p>


<h3>CANNED BEANS AND PEAS</h3>

<p>Prepare string-beans as for ordinary cooking, then press and
pack them closely into the jars until full, adding a little salt;
fill the jars to overflowing with cold water, then screw on the
covers fairly close, place the jars in a boiler, as directed above,
and cook for four hours; remove from the water, take off the
covers, place on the rubbers, screw on the covers tightly. Peas
should be shelled, then canned in the same manner.</p>


<h3>CANNED SWEET CORN</h3>

<p>Select that which is fresh, and cut from the cob as directed
for stewed sweet corn (<a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>). Then press and pack closely
into the jars until the milk appears on the top, and they are
full. No water or salt should be added. Boil for five or six
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>


<h3>CANNED PEACHES</h3>

<p>Select ripe, firm peaches, nearly soft enough to eat, avoiding
the clingstones. The Crawfords are perhaps the best. Pare,
divide in halves, removing the stones, and drop into cold water
to prevent discoloring. For each quart of fruit pour a cupful
of water into a saucepan, add three or four tablespoonfuls of
sugar, and let boil up; drain the peaches from the cold water,
and put them into the hot sirup; cook slowly till tender, and can.</p>


<h3>CANNED BERRIES</h3>

<p>Select those freshly picked; if necessary to be washed, place
a few at a time in a colander and dip in and out of cold water;
cook in a small quantity of water, adding the necessary sugar
when nearly done, and can.</p>


<h3>CANNED QUINCES</h3>

<p>Wipe with a cloth, pare, quarter, core, and divide each quarter
into thirds. For each two quarts of fruit pour three cups of
water into a saucepan, add nearly two cups of sugar, and let
boil up; then put in the fruit, and cook slowly for an hour and
a half, or until tender and of a rich pink color, and can. Equal
parts of quinces and apples or pears may be stewed together.</p>


<h3>CANNED TOMATOES</h3>

<p>Select smooth, a little under-ripe, meaty tomatoes; put them
into a pan, and pour scalding water over them to make the
skins come off readily; then with a sharp, pointed knife remove
the cores, pare, cut into thick slices, press well into the
jars, screw the covers on loosely without rubbers, place in
boiler, and cook for thirty minutes after reaching the boiling-point,
according to directions under “Another Method.” But
little filling will be needed after being cooked. For this have a
few tomatoes stewed in a saucepan. Turn upside down till
cool, then wrap in brown paper, and keep in a dark place.</p>


<h3>GRAPE JUICE</h3>

<p>Take fresh, well-ripened, dark, juicy grapes, such as the
Black Prince or Concord; pick from the stems, rejecting all
that are imperfect; wash well, and put to cook in an enameled
saucepan with a pint of water for each three quarts of grapes.
Cook slowly for half an hour, or until the grapes burst open;
then drain off the juice through a jelly-bag, filtering the skins
and seeds through a separate bag. Reheat, add one-half cup of
sugar to a quart of juice if desired to sweeten, and can in jars
the same as fruit; or, put in sterilized bottles, filling within an
inch of the top, and cork at once with good, solid corks; cut
off the corks close to the bottle, and seal over with sealing-wax.
Bottle the juice from the skins separately, as it will be
less clear. Keep in a cool, dark place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vegetarians suffer little from thirst.—<i>Hygienic Review.</i></p>

<p>Let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.—<i>Daniel.</i></p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, when writing his great work, “Principia,”
lived wholly upon a vegetable diet.</p>

<p>Body and mind are much influenced by the kind of food
habitually depended upon.—<i>O. W. Holmes.</i></p></div>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg"  alt="Leaf seperator" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">While</span> not furnishing the most nutritious diet, vegetables
contain many nutritive elements in moderate
degree, are rich in mineral substances, and being composed
largely of water, perfectly supply many of the needs of the
human system. Such vegetables, however, as peas, beans,
and lentils, properly termed legumes, are highly nutritious.
They are commonly understood to be of the nature of the
“pulse” upon which Daniel the prophet subsisted in preference
to the king’s meat. While an exclusive diet of ordinary
vegetables might fail to give sufficient nourishment
to meet the demands of the entire system, their use is valuable
in furnishing it with a large quantity of organic fluids,
and in giving bulk to the food. It is best to combine their
use with other foods, such as grains, which supply the
qualities lacking in the vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>Only fresh vegetables should be used. Those which
are stale can not be made wholesome and palatable by cooking.
Their use imperils the health of the family, and is
liable to cause serious illness. Herein lies an advantage
in having one’s own garden.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to cook vegetables too much
or too little. They should be neither overdone nor underdone,
but “just right.” Cooking vegetables, grains, and
fruits is advantageous, as it bursts the particles of starch,
and thus renders them more easy of digestion.</p>

<p>While cooking vegetables, a good, steady fire should
be kept up, and the kettle kept full of hot water for
replenishing.</p>

<p>Never replenish with cold water, but always with hot.</p>

<p>A good rule to follow in cooking vegetables is to put
to cook in hot water all vegetables that require to have
the water drained off when done, and in cold water those
that are to retain it.</p>

<p>All green vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, etc.,
should be put to cook in boiling, salted water; the dry
vegetables, such as, potatoes, carrots, beans, split peas, and
lentils should be cooked in unsalted water. About a tablespoonful
of salt should generally be allowed to a gallon
of water, or one third of a teaspoonful to every pint of
cooked vegetables.</p>

<p>In washing potatoes, a coarse cloth or brush may be
used to advantage. If to be baked, they should be wiped
dry before placing in the oven.</p>

<p>It is a matter of both economy and improvement to
pare potatoes very thin, as much of the mealiest and most
nutritious portion lies next to the skin.</p>

<p>As each potato is pared, it should be dropped into a
pan of clean, cold water; if allowed to fall back among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the parings, the potatoes will be dark and discolored when
cooked.</p>

<p>Potatoes should never be allowed to remain in the
water in which they have boiled after they are done. It
should be drained off immediately to prevent their becoming
soggy and water-soaked. If given a few vigorous
shakes, which allows the steam to escape, they will be much
more dry and mealy.</p>

<p>Old potatoes, in the spring, should be allowed to stand
in cold water for an hour before paring, to reabsorb the
moisture they have lost through evaporation.</p>

<p>In baking potatoes the oven should be hot when they
are put in, and the temperature increased rather than diminished
afterward.</p>

<p>Only dry, ripe, mealy potatoes are good baked.</p>

<p>Onions should be boiled in two waters, first for about
fifteen minutes with cold water put on, then drained off,
and boiling, salted water added to finish.</p>

<p>To peel tomatoes readily, first pour over them a little
scalding water. This also applies to plums.</p>

<h3>BOILED POTATOES (without skins)</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Saucepan</div>
</div>
<p>Wash, pare thin, and drop into cold water to prevent discoloring.
If not of a uniform size, cut the larger ones in two. Put
to cook in only enough boiling water
to prevent burning; cook gently from
twenty to thirty minutes; when done,
drain off all the water, place over the
fire for a moment, then give the
saucepan a vigorous shake, cover with
a coarse cloth, and set on the back
of the range to dry.</p>

<p>Large quantities of potatoes are
best cooked by steaming over boiling water.</p>


<h3>BOILED POTATOES (with skins)</h3>

<p>Select potatoes of even size; wash clean with a cloth or
brush, and remove the eyes and specks with a knife; put to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
cook in a small quantity of boiling water; drain when tender,
and place the saucepan on the back of the range to dry; remove
the skins and serve. Potatoes are best cooked in this
way. Serve in an open vegetable dish.</p>


<h3>BAKED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Choose smooth potatoes of uniform size, wash well, being
careful to clean the eyes. Dry with a cloth, and bake in a <i>hot</i>
oven; in a slow oven the skins become thick and hard. Serve
as soon as done, in an open dish; if covered, they will become
soggy. Baked potatoes are very wholesome, and make a good
breakfast dish.</p>


<h3>MASHED POTATOES</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_050.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Potato Masher</div>
</div>
<p>Wash, pare, and boil the same as boiled potatoes. When
they can be readily pierced with a fork, drain thoroughly;
return to the range and mash, using
the potato masher vigorously for five
or ten minutes, until they are light,
smooth, and creamy in appearance.
A wire potato masher does the work
most satisfactorily. Have warmed in a saucepan a half cupful
of cream or milk, adding a small piece of butter if milk is used,
a teaspoonful of salt, and the well-beaten white of one egg;
beat this into the potatoes until they are very light. Put lightly
into a warm dish, but do not press down, and serve at once.
If desired, the egg may be omitted. Very nice served with
cream sauce or brown sauce.</p>


<h3>STEAMED SLICED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Wash, pare, and slice several medium-sized potatoes very
thin. Have in a frying-pan a small piece of butter and a half
cup of hot water, put in the potatoes, season with salt, cover
closely, and set on the back of the range to cook slowly. Stir
up a little occasionally. A few thinly sliced onions may be
used with the potatoes if desired.</p>


<h3>WARMED-UP POTATOES</h3>

<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes into thin slices; heat a little milk to
boiling in a saucepan; put in the potatoes, and season with
salt to taste. Let boil a few minutes and serve. If desired, the
milk may be slightly thickened with a little flour blended in a
little cold milk.</p>


<h3>POTATO PUFF</h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of hot, seasoned, mashed potatoes, and
moisten well with hot milk or cream. Beat the yolks and
whites of two eggs separately; allow the potatoes to cool
slightly, then beat in the eggs, the yolks first. Turn at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
into an oiled, shallow tin; do not smooth or press them
down, but leave in a rocky form. Bake about ten minutes, or
till a delicate brown.</p>


<h3>LYONNAISE POTATOES</h3>

<p>Cut into dice enough cold boiled potatoes to make one pint,
brown to a golden yellow a spoonful each of butter or oil and
minced onion. Add the potatoes, season with salt, and stir with
a fork till a delicate brown, being careful not to break them.
Add a spoonful of chopped parsley, and serve hot.</p>


<h3>NEW POTATOES</h3>

<p>If new and fresh, the skins may be easily scraped off with a
knife, or rubbed off with a coarse cloth. Cook in a little water,
drain, and serve; or, when done, drain, pour some rich, sweet
milk over them, let it heat to boiling, then thicken with a little
flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk, allowing a tablespoonful
of flour to a pint of milk, and season with salt. A few green
peas cooked with new potatoes and thus dressed make a very
acceptable dish.</p>


<h3>POTATOES WITH CREAM</h3>

<p>Pare, and cut as many as desired into small cubes; put into
boiling water and cook from fifteen to twenty minutes; when
done, drain off all the water, let dry a few minutes over the
fire, then add a little salt, a cup of thin cream, and a little
chopped parsley; simmer for two or three minutes, and serve
at once.</p>


<h3>BAKED SWEET POTATOES</h3>

<p>Choose those of uniform size, wash thoroughly, removing
any imperfect spots, wipe dry, and place in a moderately hot
oven; bake for about an hour if the potatoes are rather large.
Small potatoes are better steamed than baked. Send to the
table as soon as done, after removing the skins.</p>


<h3>BOILED SWEET POTATOES</h3>

<p>Wash well, put into cold water with the skins on, and boil
until easily pierced with a fork; drain, remove the skins, and
place in the oven to dry for five or ten minutes; serve in a hot,
open dish.</p>


<h3>BROWNED SWEET POTATOES</h3>

<p>Take cold, boiled sweet potatoes, peel, cut into halves, place
on shallow buttered tins, and brown in a hot oven.</p>


<h3>ROASTED SWEET POTATOES</h3>

<p>Wash, wipe dry, wrap with thin paper, and cover first with
hot ashes, then with live coals. Turn occasionally. The coals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
may need renewing several times. When done, remove the
ashes with a brush, wipe with a dry cloth, and serve. Sweet
potatoes are nicer and more mealy when prepared in this way.</p>


<h3>YAMS</h3>

<p>Prepare the same as roasted sweet potatoes or baked sweet
potatoes. Boiling them is thought to quite spoil their flavor.</p>


<h3>STEWED TOMATOES</h3>

<p>Take nice, fresh tomatoes, pour boiling water over them,
remove the skins, slice into a granite saucepan, add a cupful
of water, and stew from twenty to thirty minutes. Then add
salt, butter, and a half cup of bread or cracker crumbs, or
slightly thicken with cornstarch, blended with a little cold
water. Sugar may be added if desired.</p>


<h3>BAKED TOMATOES</h3>

<p>Select smooth, even-sized, ripe tomatoes. Peel, remove the
stems, and place in an earthen pudding dish; season with a
little salt and butter or cream, and bake in a rather hot oven
for half an hour.</p>


<h3>TOMATOES AND MACARONI</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_052a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Colander</div>
</div>
<p>Put to cook one-half cup of macaroni broken into inch
pieces into three cups of boiling water;
boil for about an hour, or until perfectly
tender, adding more water if necessary.
When done, put into a pudding dish, and
pour over two cups of stewed tomatoes
previously rubbed through a colander. Add
a little salt, a few bits of butter, a half
cup of sweet cream, and bake in the oven till done. If the tomatoes
are quite juicy, a teaspoonful of flour may be used for
thickening.</p>


<h3>SCALLOPED TOMATOES</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_052b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Can Opener.</div>
</div>
<p>Take one quart of stewed fresh or canned tomatoes, rub
through a colander, and thicken with a cupful
of bread or cracker crumbs; add a little salt,
a few spoonfuls of cream, and bake for twenty
or thirty minutes.</p>


<h3>BOILED BEANS</h3>

<p>Pick over, wash, and soak two cupfuls of beans overnight in
cold water. In the morning drain, and put to cook in hot water.
Cook slowly for two or three hours, or until perfectly tender,
adding more hot water as needed, as they should be quite juicy
when done; avoid much stirring. Season with salt and a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
butter or cream. Colored beans having too strong a flavor
may be improved by parboiling for fifteen minutes, then draining,
and putting to cook in fresh boiling water.</p>


<h3>BOILED BEANS WITH RICE</h3>

<p>Wash and soak two cupfuls of beans in cold water overnight;
in the morning put to cook, and after about an hour
add one-half cup of well-washed rice. Cook slowly until done,
season as above, and serve.</p>


<h3>BAKED BEANS</h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of beans, pick over, wash, soak overnight,
and cook the same as boiled beans. When done, add a little
butter and salt, and two tablespoonfuls of molasses; turn into
a pudding dish, and bake until nicely browned. A little hot water
should be added occasionally to prevent their becoming too dry.</p>


<h3>BAKED GREEN BEANS AND CORN</h3>

<p>Shell the beans, and cut the sweet corn from the cob. Put
layers of each in equal quantities in a bean pot or pan, seasoning
with salt and butter. Add boiling water to cover, and bake
in the oven for about two hours, adding more hot water as it
becomes absorbed.</p>


<h3>MASHED BEANS</h3>

<p>Soak overnight two cupfuls of beans, and cook the same as
boiled beans. When very tender, and the water nearly absorbed,
rub through a colander to remove the skins; add half
a cup of cream or of rich, sweet milk and a little butter; put
into a shallow dish, smooth the top with a knife or spoon, and
place in the oven to brown.</p>


<h3>STRING BEANS</h3>

<p>Wash, break off each end, stripping the strong fibers from
end to end. Cut or break into inch lengths, and put to cook in
enough boiling, slightly salted water to cover. Cook from one
to two hours, or until very tender, the length of time required
depending upon the age and variety of the beans. The water
should be quite absorbed when done. Add a little milk and
butter if cream is not available. Let come to a boil, and serve.</p>


<h3>SPLIT PEAS</h3>

<p>Look over carefully, wash, and put to cook in a good quantity
of cold water. Let come to a boil, then simmer until
tender and the water quite absorbed. Press through a colander
if desired to remove the skins, season with salt, and cream or
butter, and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>


<h3>GREEN PEAS</h3>

<p>Shell, and put to cook in boiling, slightly salted water, allowing
one cupful of water to every four cups of peas. If they
are old, and need longer cooking, add more water if necessary.
Cover, and cook rather slowly till tender. About thirty minutes’
cooking for fresh, young peas will be found sufficient.
When done, pour over a cupful of sweet milk, heat to boiling,
and thicken with a little flour. Season with a little salt, and a
spoonful of cream or a small piece of butter.</p>


<h3>LENTILS</h3>

<p>Cook, season, and serve the same as split peas, only less
water and less time for cooking will be required.</p>


<h3>BAKED RICE</h3>

<p>Take one cupful of rice, wash well by turning into a colander
and dipping in and out of warm water, put into a pudding
dish, and pour over four cupfuls of milk, or two each of milk
and water, adding a little salt. Bake about an hour, stirring
once or twice before the top becomes hard. Serve as a vegetable
with lentil sauce.</p>


<h3>PLAIN BOILED RICE</h3>

<p>Wash thoroughly one cupful of rice, and sprinkle it slowly
into a granite saucepan containing two or three quarts of
rapidly boiling, slightly salted water. If the grains sink to the
bottom, stir gently until they keep in motion themselves. Boil
rapidly, without covering, for thirty minutes, or until soft;
then drain through a colander and rinse with hot water to
remove all starch. The grains should be separate and distinct
from one another. It may be served with a tomato sauce. See
<a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>


<h3>SPAGHETTI WITH TOMATO SAUCE</h3>

<p>Break in pieces and cook in boiling, salted water, or cook
whole by dipping the ends in the hot water, and as they bend,
coil them around in the saucepan. Cook for twenty or thirty
minutes, or until soft, then drain, rinse with hot water to remove
starch if it is sticky, turn into a dish and pour over a
hot tomato sauce, made as directed on <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>


<h3>STEWED CAULIFLOWER</h3>

<p>Carefully separate into small portions; examine closely to
make sure there are no insects on it; let stand a short time in
cold water, then put into boiling, salted water, and cook from
twenty to forty minutes, or until tender. Drain, season with a
little butter or cream, or serve with cream sauce poured over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>


<h3>CAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE</h3>

<p>Cook the same as stewed cauliflower. When done, drain,
turn into a dish, and pour over it a hot tomato sauce.</p>


<h3>STEWED CABBAGE</h3>

<p>Remove the outer leaves, divide into halves, cut very fine
with a sharp knife, omitting the heart. Put into a saucepan
with a half cup of boiling water, add a little salt, cover closely,
and cook until tender, adding a little more hot water, if it becomes
too dry before it is done. When done, add a few spoonfuls
of cream, allow to heat, and serve.</p>


<h3>BOILED CABBAGE</h3>

<p>Remove the outer leaves, place in cold water for half an
hour, then quarter, and put to cook in boiling water, adding a
little salt. Boil vigorously for about thirty minutes; turn into
a colander, remove the heart and coarse portions, press out all
the water, return to the saucepan, and season with butter or
cream; allow to heat, and serve on a hot dish at once.</p>


<h3>BOILED CELERY</h3>

<p>Take one bunch of celery, cut off tops and roots, scrape and
wash the stalks, then cut them into small pieces, and put to cook
in boiling water. Let cook for fifteen or twenty minutes, or
until tender; drain, turn into a heated dish, and pour over
a cream sauce. For making cream sauce see <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>


<h3>STEWED ASPARAGUS</h3>

<p>Wash, break into small pieces, and cook from twenty to
thirty minutes in just enough water to cover; when tender,
drain, add a little butter and salt and a cup of milk; let come
to a boil, and thicken with a teaspoonful of flour. Boil up and
serve.</p>


<h3>BOILED CARROTS</h3>

<p>Select small or medium-sized carrots, wash, scrape, rinse in
cold water, then put to cook in boiling water; cook about thirty
minutes, or until tender, then drain. Serve as boiled, or slice
them into a heated vegetable dish, and pour over them a cream
sauce prepared as directed on <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>


<h3>BOILED PARSNIPS</h3>

<p>Prepare and cook the same as boiled carrots.</p>


<h3>BAKED PARSNIPS</h3>

<p>Wash, scrape, rinse, divide in halves, add a little more than
enough boiling water to cook them, and boil slowly until ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>der;
place in a shallow dish, pour over the juice that remains,
add a little salt, a spoonful or two of cream, and place in the
oven until nicely browned, basting occasionally.</p>


<h3>STEWED TURNIPS</h3>

<p>Pare the turnips, cut into slices, and cook until perfectly
tender; then drain, mash fine with a spoon or potato masher,
season with salt, a little butter or cream if desired, and serve.</p>


<h3>SLICED CUCUMBERS</h3>

<p>Pare the cucumbers, slice them very thin into a dish,
sprinkle with salt, cover loosely, and shake briskly to distribute
the salt; let stand for about half an hour; then drain off
all the water, and shortly before serving pour over the juice of
one or two lemons. A spoonful or two of cream may be added
if desired. Cucumbers should be thoroughly masticated. Their
reputed indigestibility is largely due to a failure in this particular.</p>


<h3>BOILED ONIONS</h3>

<p>Cut off the tops and bottoms, remove the outer skins, and
put to cook in cold water; boil fifteen minutes; then drain, and
cook in boiling, salted water until tender; turn into a pudding
dish, and cut into small pieces; pour over a cupful of hot cream
sauce, sprinkle the top with bread crumbs, and bake until
brown. For making cream sauce see <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>


<h3>BAKED SQUASH</h3>

<p>Cut into sections, and place shell downward on the top shelf
of the oven. Bake until tender, and serve hot in the shell; or,
scrape out the inside, mash, add a few spoonfuls of cream or a
little butter, and serve.</p>


<h3>STEWED SQUASH</h3>

<p>Peel, remove seeds, cut into small pieces, and stew until tender
in a little boiling water; drain, mash smooth, and season
with butter and salt. Vegetable marrows may be prepared in
the same manner.</p>


<h3>SUCCOTASH</h3>

<p>Soak one cupful of beans overnight. When ready to cook,
add water and one cupful of dried sweet corn, and cook until
tender. Season with salt, a little cream or butter, and serve.
If green sweet corn is used, do not add it to the beans until
they are nearly done.</p>


<h3>BOILED SWEET CORN</h3>

<p>Select full-grown ears, not old and hard, but full of milk;
remove the husks and silks, and put to cook in enough boiling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
salted water to cover. Boil from thirty to forty minutes; when
done, drain, and serve on the cob hot, with a little butter if
desired. The corn from ears not eaten may be cut from the cob
and warmed up with a little cream or butter for the next meal.</p>


<h3>STEWED SWEET CORN</h3>

<p>Remove husks and silks, stand the ears in a dish, and with a
sharp knife cut off the corn from the top downward, taking a
little more than half of the kernel in depth; then scrape gently
downward to get the remainder of the milk and meat of each
kernel. Place in a saucepan, add half a cup of water for each
quart of corn, and cook for fifteen or twenty minutes. When
done, add a little salt, a half cup of cream, or a cup of milk and
a little butter, boil up and serve. The milk may be slightly
thickened with flour, if desired.</p>


<h3>BAKED BEETS</h3>

<p>Take young, tender beets, wash clean, place in a baking dish
with a little water, and bake from one to two hours, or until
tender; add a little hot water occasionally if they become dry.
When done, remove the skins, slice, and serve with lemon-juice.</p>


<h3>BOILED BEETS</h3>

<p>Cut off the tops, but avoid cutting the beets; put to cook in
boiling water. When tender, remove to a pan of cold water;
rub off the skins with the hands, slice thin, and serve with
lemon-juice.</p>


<h3>BEET GREENS</h3>

<p>Take the tops from young, tender beets, look over, put to
cook in boiling, slightly salted water, and cook until tender;
then drain in a colander; chop rather fine, and serve with lemon-juice.</p>


<h3>SPINACH</h3>

<p>Look over carefully a good quantity of spinach, rejecting all
wilted and decayed leaves. Wash thoroughly in several waters,
and put to cook in slightly salted, boiling water, and boil from
twenty to thirty minutes. When tender, drain in a colander, cut
into coarse pieces, and put into a warm dish; add a few bits of
butter, and garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs. Serve with
lemon-juice.</p>


<h3>CELERY</h3>

<p>Remove all the green and decayed parts from the stalks, and
put into cold water. When ready to serve, place in a celery
glass with the small ends downward. Curl the tops by cutting
into narrow strips a little way down. Celery is recommended
as a good nerve food.</p></blockquote>

<h3>TOMATO SALAD, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Peel smooth, ripe tomatoes, cut into thin slices, and arrange
in layers in a dish, sprinkling each layer with sugar. Turn over
the whole a half cup of lemon-juice before serving.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SALAD, NO. 2</h3>

juice of two lemons, and pour over the cabbage; add a spoonful
or two of thick cream, stir together, and serve. The cream may
be omitted if preferred.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE SALAD, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Chop the cabbage fine, and dress with mayonnaise dressing.
If preferred omit to thin the dressing with cream, and cover the
cabbage with whipped cream, slightly sweetened.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE AND TOMATO SALAD</h3>

<p>Cut the cabbage as above, and put into a dish. Peel and slice
two or three large, ripe tomatoes, and place on the cabbage.
Toss up lightly in the dish, sprinkle with sugar, and pour over
all the juice of two lemons.</p>


<h3>LETTUCE SALAD, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Separate the leaves, look over, wash, and put into cold water
a while before using. When ready to serve, place on a dish and
pour over a dressing made of equal quantities of lemon-juice,
sugar, and water.</p>


<h3>LETTUCE SALAD, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Wash and shred two heads of lettuce. Boil two eggs until
hard, remove the shells, and mash the yolks fine; mix well
together the juice of one or two lemons, two or three table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>spoonfuls
of water, one tablespoonful of sugar, one-half teaspoonful
of salt, one tablespoonful of sweet cream, adding this
last to prevent curdling, and the yolks of the eggs, and pour
over the lettuce. Cut the whites of the eggs into rings and
arrange on the top. A spoonful or two of minced onion may
also be added.</p>


<h3>POTATO SALAD</h3>

<p>Cut into thin slices, hot or cold boiled potatoes, and place in
a dish without breaking slices. A small onion, chopped fine, to
each pint of potatoes may be added if desired. Cover with mayonnaise
dressing.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE SALAD</h3>

<p>Put a layer of fresh watercress or lettuce into a salad bowl,
then alternate with layers of peeled, thinly sliced cucumber and
tomatoes. When enough is prepared, place a border of watercress
around the bowl. Just before serving, pour over a French
dressing, and toss up lightly with a fork till well mingled.</p>


<h3>FRUIT SALAD</h3>

<p>Place in salad dish alternate layers of sliced bananas and
strawberries, sprinkling each layer with sugar. Cover with
whipped cream, and serve.</p>


<h3>BANANA SALAD</h3>

<p>Slice crosswise six ripe bananas into a dish; sprinkle with
powdered sugar, then turn over them the juice of two nice large
oranges; let stand for an hour in a cool place, and serve.</p>


<h3>NUT AND CELERY SALAD</h3>

<p>Take three cupfuls of finely cut, crisp celery, and one cupful
of chopped English walnuts; dress with mayonnaise dressing,
made thin with a little sweet cream.</p>


<h3>FRENCH DRESSING</h3>

<p>Mix thoroughly together six tablespoonfuls of oil, a pinch
of salt, and two tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.</p>


<h3>MAYONNAISE DRESSING</h3>

<p>To the yolks of two fresh eggs add a scant teaspoonful of
salt; then beat in slowly, almost drop by drop, a small cupful
of olive-oil. The mixture should become nearly as thick as
butter. Then gradually add one tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
Thin with sweet cream. Nice for potato, cabbage, or nut
salads. If used for tomato salad, omit the cream.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a man eateth, so is he.—<i>German Proverb.</i></p>

<p>The liability to disease is increased by flesh eating. Where
plenty of good milk and fruit can be obtained, there is rarely
any excuse for eating animal food.—“<i>Christian Temperance.</i>”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg"  alt="Leaf separator" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> the instruction given at the beginning respecting
foods, it is evident the Creator did not design that
either man or beast should subsist on flesh foods. To
Adam and Eve he said: “Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth,
and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding
seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of
the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything
that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have
given every green herb for meat.” Gen. 1:29, 30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>But sin brought many changes into our world, and
because of the changed circumstances, customs, and practises
were instituted and allowed which were not in harmony
with the primeval order of things. Among other
things meat eating was permitted. Just after the flood,
when the face of the earth had been desolated, God said to
Noah: “Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for
you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.”
Gen. 9:3. But the blood was not to be eaten with the
flesh,—a very wise provision, for if there is any disease
in the system, it is sure to be found in the blood.</p>

<p>A little later, as a further precaution in the interests of
health, instruction was given that only the flesh of “clean
beasts” was to be eaten, such as that of the ox, the sheep,
the goat, the deer, etc. See Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy
14.</p>

<p>But for all this it must be admitted that the flesh of
animals is not a natural diet for man, nor does it constitute
the most healthful food. Of this it may be truly said
as Christ said of the granting of a writing of divorcement,
it was suffered because of the “hardness” of their hearts,
“but from the beginning it was not so.” Matt. 19:8. It
was never intended that man should take the life of any
innocent, living creature.</p>

<p>Meat eating tends to excite the passions. This is seen
in the animal kingdom. The animals that are mild, patient,
and docile are generally herbivorous, such as the cow, the
sheep, the horse; while the excitable, quick-tempered, and
ferocious animals are meat eaters, such as the lion, the
tiger, the leopard. A meat diet also tends to constipation,
the great scourge of the race.</p>

<p>One object of this work, therefore, is in the interests
of health and morality, to educate people out of meat eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>ing
rather than into it; and to supply such a variety of
recipes for good, wholesome, palatable, and nutritious
dishes, prepared from natural food elements, that meat
eating will be practically unnecessary.</p>

<p>Moreover, so many animals at the present time are
becoming so greatly diseased that it is not a little dangerous
to eat largely of their flesh. As a matter of safety the
use of flesh-meats might very consistently be dispensed
with altogether.</p>

<p>The fact, therefore, that meat may be cheap, or that it
may be easily or quickly prepared, should count for little
with those who have the best interests of their families in
view.</p>

<p>From every standpoint from which the subject may be
viewed, the reasons for discontinuing the use of flesh-meats
are more imperative now than ever before.</p>

<p>1. This is an age of disease. Animals are coming to
be greatly diseased. The use of their flesh, therefore, tends
to increase disease in mankind, and thus to shorten life.</p>

<p>2. This is an age of intemperance. Flesh-meats are
all more or less stimulating. Their use, therefore, tends to
increase this evil.</p>

<p>3. This is an age of surfeiting. Meat eating is, to a
large degree, responsible for this. A well-known English
writer on cookery says: “No one will deny that the foods
we are apt to eat too much of are those absent from a
purely vegetarian fare, such as meat, game, fish, eggs,
etc., upon which materials the culinary art seems exercised
to tempt us beyond the satisfying of the appetite.”</p>

<p>4. This is an age of vice and immorality. A meat diet
tends greatly to increase this terrible evil.</p>

<p>5. This is an age of violence and murder. The practise
of killing and eating animals tends to harden men’s hearts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to destroy their finer sensibilities, and thus to increase violence
and crime.</p>

<p>In the beginning God gave man no flesh foods to eat.
And after the Exodus, when he had his own way with his
own people, he gave them no flesh to eat. Before taking
them into the promised land, for forty years he fed them
on “manna,” a purely vegetarian food. Ex. 16:31; Num.
11:7, 8. And when they “fell a lusting,” and said, “Who
shall give us flesh to eat?” he was displeased with them,
and, with the giving of the quails, brought a great plague
upon them. Numbers 11; Ps. 78:18-31.</p>

<p>In the New Testament, the apostle, referring to this
experience, warns Christians against falling into the same
error. “Now these things,” he says, “were our examples,
to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they
also lusted.... And they are written for our admonition,
upon whom the ends of the world are come.” 1 Cor.
10:5-11.</p>

<p>Evidently, therefore, meat eating is not in harmony
with God’s original plan. And it must be that the nearer
we bring ourselves into harmony with that plan, the better
it will be for us.</p>

<p>To some it may seem difficult to give up the use of
meat. But in this, as in all reformatory work, much depends
upon the mind. Let the correct principle be first
assented to; then, step by step, let the practise be brought
into conformity to the principle, making changes gradually,
if necessary, leaving off the meat dishes as others more
wholesome can be substituted. We should cultivate a love
for that which we know to be good and healthful.</p>

<p>To assist those who desire to make this dietetic reform,
a few recipes are here given which will be found to be
good substitutes for meats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<blockquote>
<h3>VEGETABLE AND LENTIL STEW</h3>

<p>Soak one-half cup of lentils in a cup of cold water for an
hour; then put to cook in three cups of hot water with one
turnip, three or four medium-sized potatoes, a small onion, and
a stalk or two of celery, all cut into small pieces. Stew for
about half an hour, or until well done, and the water quite
absorbed. Season with salt, and serve with brown sauce.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE HASH</h3>

<p>Boil separately in a small quantity of water, three or four
medium-sized potatoes sliced fine, two turnips, one carrot, and
an onion, all cut into fine pieces; when done, drain, and turn all
together into a saucepan; season with salt, add a teaspoonful
of dry, powdered sage, a half cup of sweet cream, or the same
quantity of milk, and a small piece of butter, and heat to boiling;
then stir in one or two tablespoonfuls of browned flour
rubbed to a paste in a little cold water, cook a few minutes
longer, and serve hot.</p>


<h3>POTATO ROLLS</h3>

<p>Take two potatoes, one turnip, a small onion, a stalk of celery,
and a little powdered sage; chop all into very fine pieces
and mix well together, adding salt as desired. Make a paste as
for pies, roll out rather thin, cut into squares, and place on
each square as much of the mixture as it will hold; wet the
edges, and fold up as a sausage roll, pressing the dough together
at the ends, place in a pan and bake from thirty to forty minutes
in a moderate oven. Serve hot. Very nice.</p>


<h3>BREAD STEAK</h3>

<p>Dip slices of stale bread or toast in a little milk or cream
to slightly soften; sprinkle with a little salt; beat up an egg
or two, dip in the slices, place in a hot frying-pan with a little
butter, and brown on both sides. Serve with brown sauce.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT FRITTERS</h3>

<p>Rub one tablespoonful of butter into two cupfuls of fine
breads crumbs, adding a little chopped parsley or other herb
flavoring, and season with salt; then add one cup of thin cream
or rich milk, and three eggs beaten separately. Stir well, and
bake in fritters, in a hot frying-pan, or on a griddle, rubbed
with a little butter, browning lightly on both sides. Serve with
brown sauce.</p>


<h3>“PRAIRIE” FISH</h3>

<p>Cut thick, cold, corn-meal mush into slices about half an inch
thick; roll in flour, and brown on both sides in a hot, buttered
frying-pan; or brush with thick, sweet cream, and brown in the
oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>


<h3>BOILED MACARONI</h3>

<p>If dusty, wipe with a dry cloth instead of washing, then take
a cupful broken into small pieces, and put to cook in boiling,
salted water; cook until tender, adding more hot water occasionally
if necessary. When done, drain, and serve hot with a
little cream; or pour over a pint of milk, heat to boiling, and
stir in the yolk of one well-beaten egg and a little salt; or omit
the egg, and thicken with a tablespoonful of flour rubbed
smooth in a little cold milk.</p>


<h3>PEANUT SAUSAGE</h3>

<p>Thoroughly mix to a cream one level tablespoonful of peanut
butter with two tablespoonfuls of cold water; then add
three tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs, a pinch of salt,
and a teaspoonful of minced onion or powdered sage; mix all
well together, form into small cakes with the hands, and place
in an oiled, heated frying-pan till nicely browned, turning and
browning on both sides. Place on a platter, and garnish with
sprigs of parsley. Serve with brown sauce, No. 2, <a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>.
Very tasty.</p>


<h3>PEAS PUREE</h3>

<p>Soak a cupful or two, or as many as needed, of split peas
overnight in cold water. In the morning wash, drain, and put
to cook in boiling water, and cook slowly. When very tender,
and quite dry, mash smooth, season with salt and a little sweet
cream. Serve hot.</p>


<h3>STEWED SALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTERS</h3>

<p>Wash, scrape, cut into slices about one fourth of an inch in
thickness, and drop at once into cold water to prevent discoloring.
Then put to cook in an enameled saucepan, in a small
quantity of boiling water, about equal parts of water and salsify,
adding a little salt. Cook from twenty to fifty minutes,
according to age, and when tender add a little more water if
at all dry, a cupful of cream or rich milk, and simmer for a few
minutes. Have ready in a dish some slices of toasted bread cut
in halves, pour over the salsify, and serve.</p>


<h3>LENTIL RISSOLES</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of well-cooked brown lentils and cold
boiled potatoes and mash well together; then add one third that
amount of fine bread crumbs, a teaspoonful each of powdered
sage and minced onion, and a little salt. Dissolve a teaspoonful
of nut butter in two tablespoonfuls of hot water; and add to the
mixture. Mix all well together, press into an oiled tin, cut into
squares with a knife, and place in the oven for fifteen or twenty
minutes. Serve hot.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h3>BOILED EGGS</h3>

<p>If desired to have the white set, but the yolk a liquid, boil
eggs three minutes; then remove from the fire and leave them
in the hot water a moment or two to set the whites. The water
should be boiling when the eggs are dropped in.</p>

<p>If desired to have the yolks dry and mealy, and at the same
time the whites not hard, tough, and leathery, place the eggs
in boiling water, then let simmer in water a little below the
boiling-point, or at a temperature not above 165° Fahrenheit,
for about twenty minutes. Eggs are best cooked thus.</p>

<p>For garnishing salads, etc., boil about twenty minutes, then
immediately place a moment in cold water to prevent the
whites becoming discolored, and to make the shells remove
easily.</p>


<h3>POACHED EGGS</h3>

<p>Put into a shallow pan as much hot water as will cover the
eggs well. A tablespoonful of lemon-juice may be added to the
water to make the eggs white. Break the eggs one at a time
into a cup and slip gently into the water, which should not
boil, but only simmer. Let stand for about five minutes, or
until the white is firm, but not hard, and the yolk enveloped in
a film of white. Remove each egg with a skimmer, or large
spoon, drain, trim the edges, and serve in egg saucers, or on
toast. Make a thin cream sauce and pour around them if desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>


<h3>SCRAMBLED EGGS</h3>

<p>For each egg allow two tablespoonfuls of boiling water or
milk. Break the eggs into a dish, beat lightly with a spoon,
add a little salt, drop into the boiling water or milk, and stir
briskly until set, but soft. They are nice thus served on toast.</p>


<h3>STEAMED EGGS</h3>

<p>Break the eggs into egg dishes or oiled patty-pans, sprinkle
with salt, and steam over boiling water until the whites are set
and a film covers the yolk. Serve with or without toast.</p>


<h3>SCALLOPED EGGS</h3>

<p>Boil five or six eggs for twenty minutes; remove the shells,
and cut the eggs into thin slices; put a layer of grated or fine
bread crumbs into a buttered pudding dish, then a layer of the
sliced eggs; sprinkle with salt, then add another layer of
bread crumbs, then another of egg, and so on till the dish is
filled, having a layer of crumbs for the top. Heat a cup of
milk to boiling, and pour over the scallop; sprinkle over a few
more crumbs, and bake until slightly browned.</p>


<h3>BAKED EGGS</h3>

<p>Break the required number of eggs into a shallow baking
pan, or small patty-pans, previously buttered, to prevent sticking.
Season with salt, and bake until set. Remove to a warm
platter, and serve at once.</p>


<h3>EGG SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Mash the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, a sprinkle of salt,
and a little chopped cress, smooth and fine; spread this on thin
slices of bread slightly buttered, and press together.</p>


<h3>EGGS AND TOMATO SAUCE</h3>

<p>Melt a spoonful of butter in a deep dish, break in carefully
the number of eggs desired, and place on the stove until they
begin to set; then pour over them a hot tomato sauce, made
after directions on <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>.</p>


<h3>EGGS ON TOAST</h3>

<p>Boil three eggs for twenty minutes. Put one tablespoonful
of butter into a frying-pan. When hot, stir in one tablespoonful
of flour, one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, and gradually, to
avoid lumps forming, one cupful of milk. Add the whites of the
three eggs, chopped fine. When hot, pour over three or four
slices of moistened toast. Put the yolks through a sieve or
vegetable press over the toast, garnish with bits of parsley, and
serve hot.</p></blockquote>

<h3>PLAIN OMELET</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks and whites of three eggs separately; allow
one tablespoonful of milk to each egg. Stir the milk and yolks
of the eggs well together and season with salt; then with a
spoon carefully fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs.
Turn all into a hot frying-pan, sufficiently buttered to prevent
sticking. Cook rather quickly, being careful not to burn. Carefully
lift the edges of the omelet while cooking, with a knife or
spoon, that it may be equally cooked. When well set, double
one part over the other, remove to a warm dish, and serve at
once, as an omelet is not so good when cold. It should be very
light and tender, and nicely browned.</p>

<h3>SAGO PUDDING</h3>

<p>To five cups of boiling water add a cup of sago, previously
soaked in a cup of cold water for twenty minutes, two thirds
of a cup of sugar, and a half cup of well-washed raisins. Cook
all together till transparent, flavor with lemon or vanilla, and
serve with cream or boiled custard sauce.</p>


<h3>TAPIOCA PUDDING</h3>

<p>Soak one cupful of tapioca overnight in a pint of water. In
the morning add one quart of milk, stirring gently, and boil
about twenty minutes; then add the yolks of four eggs well
beaten, and one cup of sugar, and boil a few minutes longer;
pour into an earthen dish, and flavor with a teaspoonful of
vanilla; cover with a meringue made of the whites of the four
eggs beaten stiff, and four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar,
and place in a slow oven to brown slightly. Serve cold.</p>


<h3>RICE PUDDING</h3>

<p>Take a cupful of boiled rice, and a half cup of washed raisins,
and mix together in a pudding dish. Beat well together two
eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two cupfuls of milk, and
pour over the raisins and rice. Bake in a moderate oven until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the custard is just set. If left in too long, the milk becomes
watery. This is a good way to use up left-over rice.</p>


<h3>CORNSTARCH PUDDING</h3>

<p>Take three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch and stir smooth in
a little cold water; over this pour one pint of boiling water;
then stir in the whites of three eggs beaten stiff, one tablespoonful
of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Steam fifteen minutes,
or cook slowly until thickened. Serve cold with a sauce prepared
as follows: Heat one cup of milk to boiling; beat together
the yolks of the three eggs and one-half cup of sugar
until creamy, and stir into the milk; boil until smooth, and remove
from the fire at once. Flavor with lemon or vanilla, and
allow to cool.</p>


<h3>BREAD PUDDING, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Take one pint of bread crumbs, and pour over them one
quart of milk; then add the yolks of four eggs well beaten,
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and bake in the oven. When done,
spread the top with jelly or marmalade, and cover with a
meringue made of the four whites of the eggs beaten stiff, and
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Brown slightly, and
serve warm or cold, with or without sauce or cream, as preferred.</p>


<h3>BREAD PUDDING, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Cut stale bread into cubes, and moisten with milk or water;
then pour over a mixture of eggs, sugar, and milk, allowing one
egg and one tablespoonful of sugar to each cup of milk. Steam
or bake. Currants or raisins may be added.</p>


<h3>COLD PEACH PUDDING</h3>

<p>Cut slices of stale bread into strips, and line a pudding basin
or round mold as neatly as possible. Then fill the center of the
mold with stewed fresh or canned peaches, slightly warmed,
add sugar to sweeten, and place a slice of bread over the fruit.
Pour over enough of the sirup or fruit juice to soak all the
bread. Take a saucer or plate about the size of the mold, and
place it upside down on top, over the pudding, and put a heavy
weight on the plate. Let stand overnight, and in the morning
turn into a glass dish for the table. Cut into slices, and serve
with milk or cream. Raspberries or blackberries may be used
instead of peaches.</p>


<h3>PRUNE WHIP</h3>

<p>Wash thoroughly one-half pound of prunes and soak for an
hour in cold water enough to cover; cook gently in the same
water until the prunes are tender, and the juice is nearly absorbed.
Then rub through a colander. When cold, add two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little lemon-juice, and the stiffly
beaten whites of three eggs. Stir all well together, pile lightly
in a buttered pudding dish, and bake about ten minutes, or until
a delicate brown. Serve with whipped cream or boiled custard
sauce. See pages <a href='#Page_79'>79</a> and <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>.</p>


<h3>FIG PUDDING</h3>

<p>Take half a pound of finely chopped figs, one cupful of bread
crumbs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of
melted butter, one cupful of milk, two eggs well beaten, and a
pinch of salt. Stir all well together, turn into a double boiler,
slightly buttered, or into a saucepan placed in boiling water,
and boil about an hour. Serve with lemon sauce.</p>


<h3>RICE LEMON PUDDING</h3>

<p>To three-fourths cupful of well-washed rice, add three cupfuls
of boiling water and a half teaspoonful of salt, and cook
in a double boiler until tender. When done, allow to cool, then
add the yolks of three eggs well beaten, a teaspoonful of
butter, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, the grated rind of a lemon,
and one cup of milk; stir together, and bake in the oven until
set. When done, cover the top with a meringue made with
the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, two-thirds cup of sugar, and
the juice of one lemon; place in the oven to brown slightly.
Serve either warm or cold.</p>


<h3>RICE APPLE PUDDING</h3>

<p>Boil two tablespoonfuls of well-washed rice in half a pint of
milk until soft; then stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs and
sugar to sweeten. Make a wall with the rice around a dish; fill
the center of the dish with stewed apples, and cover the whole
with the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth; sprinkle
with powdered sugar, and brown lightly in the oven; serve with
plain or whipped cream.</p>


<h3>CRACKER PUDDING</h3>

<p>Put three cupfuls of rich milk into a pudding dish; sprinkle
in two cupfuls of crackers, first heated in the oven till crisp, but
not browned, and afterward crushed fine with a rolling-pin.

heat just to boiling; then stir in five tablespoonfuls of cornstarch
mixed thoroughly with two well-beaten eggs; flavor with
lemon or vanilla, and pour into cups, previously wet in cold
water, to mold. Place a mold of jelly in the center of a platter,
and arrange the molds of blanc-mange around it. A portion of
the blanc-mange may be colored and flavored with chocolate,
so that each alternate mold on the platter will be brown. Serve
with cream.</p>


<h3>APPLE BATTER PUDDING</h3>

<p>Pare and slice six medium-sized cooking apples into a buttered
pudding dish, adding sugar to sweeten. Make a batter
as follows: Beat three eggs to a foam; then add five tablespoonfuls
of sifted flour, sprinkling it in while beating vigorously, and
half a teaspoonful of salt. Stir in gradually enough milk to
make of the consistency of thick cream, beat well, and pour
over the apples, and bake until done. Serve with cream or rich
milk.</p>


<h3>APPLE TRIFLE</h3>

adding the juice and grated rind of a lemon. When done, add
sugar to sweeten, and turn into a deep glass dish. Heat a pint
of milk to boiling, stir in three well-beaten eggs, saving out the
white of one, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and cook until
thickened. When cold pour over the apples in the dish. Beat
the white of the egg to a stiff froth and drop by spoonfuls into
a pan of boiling water for a moment, turn, then remove, and
use to ornament the pudding.</p>


<h3>APPLES WITH TAPIOCA</h3>

<p>Soak a cupful of tapioca in two cupfuls of cold water for an
hour; then spread on a clean white cloth, and place some pared
and sliced apples, sugar, and grated lemon peel in the center;
tie up the cloth loosely so that the tapioca will surround the
apples, and put into boiling water; boil half an hour, or until
done; then turn out the whole into a dish. Serve with boiled
custard, whipped cream, or fruit jelly.</p>


<h3>FRUIT TAPIOCA</h3>

<p>Cook three-fourths cup of tapioca in four cups of water
until smooth and transparent. Stir into it lightly a pint of fresh
or canned strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries, adding
sugar as required. Serve cold with cream, or a pint of fruit
sauce.</p>

has begun to swell, add a cupful of well-washed raisins. When
done, serve with fruit juice, milk, or cream.</p>


<h3>RICE WITH FIGS</h3>

<p>Soak and cook the rice as directed for peaches and rice.
Wash a small quantity of figs, and stew with a little sugar until
thoroughly done; serve a spoonful of the figs with each dish
of rice. The fig sauce should be so thick that it will not run
over the rice.</p>


<h3>APPLE RICE</h3>

<p>Fill a pudding dish half full with tart apples, pared, quartered,
cored, and sprinkled with sugar. Wash thoroughly half
a cupful of rice and sprinkle over apples in pudding dish. Cover,
steam until the rice is tender, and serve with cream and sugar.</p>


<h3>APPLES WITH RAISINS</h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and core half a dozen good cooking apples.
Wash a small cup of raisins, and put to cook in a quart of
boiling water. When they have begun to swell, add the apples,
a little sugar to sweeten, and cook until tender.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT PUDDING</h3>

<p>To one pint of milk, add two tablespoonfuls of desiccated
cocoanut, and heat to boiling; remove the cocoanut by turning
through a strainer; then add to the milk one-half cup of sugar
and one-half cup of fine cracker or bread crumbs, cool a few
minutes, then add the beaten yolks of two eggs. Turn into a
pudding dish, set it inside a pan of hot water, and bake in the

transparent. Have ready in a pudding dish a pint of fresh,
pitted cherries; sprinkle them with sugar, then pour over them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the cooked tapioca, and bake for half an hour in a moderate
oven. Serve with or without cream.</p>


<h3>MINUTE PUDDING</h3>

<p>Put one quart of milk into the inner vessel of a double
boiler, or into an ordinary saucepan greased with a little butter,
and heat to boiling; then stir in two small cups of flour, sifting
it in a little at a time, and stirring briskly, that no lumps may
be formed. Just before removing from the fire, add two well-beaten
eggs, stir a moment, and serve at once with cream, and
a little sugar if desired. If preferred, the eggs may be omitted.</p>


<h3>ARROWROOT BLANC-MANGE</h3>

<p>Heat a pint of milk to boiling; then stir in two heaping tablespoonfuls
of arrowroot rubbed smooth in a half cup of cold
milk, and a half cup of sugar; cook for a few minutes until
thickened, stirring well, and pour into cups or molds previously
wet in cold water, to cool. Serve with stewed fruit or fruit
juice.</p>


<h3>RICE SNOW WITH JELLY</h3>

<p>Cook one cupful of rice in milk until tender, adding a little
salt. When done, pile loosely in a dish; beat the whites of two
or three eggs till stiff, mix with a half cupful of sugar, and pile
in heaps like snow over the rice; ornament with bits of jelly,
and, if in season, put a circle of fresh berries around the edge
when ready to serve.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the greatest objections to pies is that they are
generally made too rich. When a large amount of
grease is employed in making the crust, and the filling is
seasoned heavily with spices and various condiments, they
can hardly fail to be unwholesome.</p>

<p>But pies need not be made in this way. If proper ingredients
are used, and simplicity is studied in making them,
there is no reason why they should be seriously objectionable.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_080b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Pie Dish</div>
</div>

<p>There are two styles of pie in general use,—one, the
English style, baked in a deep dish, frequently
with only a top crust; the other,
the American, baked in a shallow dish,
usually with two crusts, an upper and an
under. Custard, cream, lemon, and pumpkin pies, however,
have only an under crust. Most of the recipes here given
are for the shallow pies with two crusts.</p>

<p>Custard, pumpkin, and other pies in which milk and
eggs are used, should be baked in a slow oven. They will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
also be improved if the milk used be hot. To stir beaten
eggs into the hot milk, add a few spoonfuls of cold milk
to the eggs, then pour into the hot milk, a little at a time,
stirring well.</p>

<p>The filling for pies should always be prepared before
making the crust, unless the crust is to be baked first. All
the material should be cold, except for custard and pumpkin
pies, and should be put together quickly, handling as little
as possible, and without kneading the dough.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_081a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Rolling-pin</div>
</div>
<p>When the paste is ready, take sufficient for one crust,
and roll out on a floured board quickly and lightly until
about an eighth of an inch
in thickness, and a little
larger than the pie dish,
as it will shrink when
lifted from the board. When rolled thin, flour or oil the
pie dish, cover smoothly with the crust, and fill, adding
sugar as required. Sprinkle a little flour over the sugar;
this thickens the juice slightly, and prevents the upper crust
from becoming soggy. For custard or fruit pies with wet
fillings, brush the bottom crust with the white of an egg
before putting in the filling. The crust will then remain
dry and tender.</p>


<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_081b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Pie</div>
</div>
<p>If there is to be a top crust, roll it out in the same
manner, and make a few ornamental cuts
in the center to allow the steam to escape.
Wet the edge of the lower crust, and lift
on the upper crust, pressing the edges
together so that the juice may not escape. Trim away the
overhanging portions, and with the thumb and fingers
press the edge into a scalloped or ornamental wall, as
shown in the accompanying cut. Especially should this
be done when only an under crust is used, that the pie may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
be handled with greater ease. It also adds to the appearance
of the pie. Pies are generally better eaten the same
day they are baked.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/leaf.jpg"  alt="Leaf separator" />
</div>


<h3>PLAIN PIE CRUST</h3>

<p>For each pie with two crusts take two small cups of sifted
flour, and work thoroughly into it three tablespoonfuls of butter,
adding a little salt; wet with just sufficient cold water to make a
rather stiff dough; mix quickly, roll out thin, and bake as soon
as the pie can be made. A good crust may be made with olive-oil,
or fresh cocoanut or vegetable oil, instead of butter, using
about the same quantity.</p>


<h3>CREAM PIE CRUST</h3>

<p>Take two scant cups of fine, sifted flour, or equal parts of
fine flour and Graham flour, add a little salt, and moisten with
enough cold, thin sweet cream to make a rather stiff dough;
roll out thin, place in the pie dish, fill, and bake quickly.</p>


<h3>APPLE PIE</h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice thin, tart ripe apples; line the pie dish
with a crust, and fill with the apples; sprinkle with sugar, and
add two or three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Cover with an
upper crust, according to general directions, and bake until a
light brown. Apples that do not cook quickly may be stewed
until about half done before making into pies. Apple pie when
cold is very nice served with sweet cream.</p>


<h3>PEACH PIE</h3>

<p>Pare, remove stones, and make the same as apple pie.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY PIE</h3>

<p>Remove the stems and blossom ends, wash, and fill a pie
dish lined with a crust. Add a half cup of sugar, and sprinkle
with flour. Prepare the upper crust, cover, and bake. To prevent
the juice from running out while baking, make a paste of
a teaspoonful of flour and a little water, and brush over the
edge of the under crust before putting on the top crust. If
desired, beat together the white of an egg and a tablespoonful
of fine sugar, and meringue the top of the pie when done;
return to the oven, and brown slightly.</p>


<h3>RHUBARB PIE</h3>

<p>Wash, strip off the skin, and cut the stalks into thin slices.
Line a pie dish with crust, and fill with the rhubarb. Add a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
half cup of sugar, two or three tablespoonfuls of water, and
sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour. Wet the edges of the
lower crust, place on a prepared top crust, press the edges together,
trim, and bake. Equal portions of rhubarb and apples
may be used in the place of all rhubarb.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY PIE</h3>

<p>Look over the raspberries, line a pie dish with a crust and
fill with berries; add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little water,
sprinkle with flour, and proceed as with gooseberry pie.</p>


<h3>BLACKBERRY PIE</h3>

<p>Look over about one pint of blackberries, and proceed the
same as for raspberry pie. Blueberry pie may be made in the
same way.</p>


<h3>CHERRY PIE</h3>

<p>Take nice ripe cherries, remove the stones if preferred, and
make the same as raspberry pie, adding sugar according to the
acidity of the fruit.</p>


<h3>DRIED CURRANT PIE</h3>

<p>Wash the currants in two or three waters through a colander
to remove sand and grit, and stew; when cool, line a pie dish
with crust, and fill with the currants, pouring in a small quantity
of the juice; add a little sugar, then sprinkle over with two
tablespoonfuls of flour, cover with a crust, and bake in a hot
oven till done. It should not be made too dry.</p>


<h3>PRUNE PIE</h3>

<p>Wash the prunes well in warm water, rinse, soak, and put
to cook without draining, cover, and stew slowly from one to
two hours. When done, put through a colander to remove
stones and skins. Bake with two crusts. Very little sugar will
be needed. If the pulp is quite juicy, a tablespoonful of flour
may be sprinkled over.</p>


<h3>LEMON PIE</h3>

<p>To one cupful of boiling water, add one heaping tablespoonful
of cornstarch blended with a little cold water. Boil up,
remove from the fire, and stir in two-thirds cup of sugar; let
cool, then add the beaten yolks of two eggs, and the juice and
grated rind of a lemon. Bake with under crust only; when
done, meringue the top with a tablespoonful of sugar and the
whites of the eggs beaten stiff; return to a slow oven to brown
slightly.</p>


<h3>DRIED APPLE PIE</h3>

<p>Take good dried apples, wash, and soak for several hours, or
overnight, in sufficient cold water to cover them. Stew, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>out
draining, until soft; mash fine, adding lemon flavoring and
sugar to sweeten; bake with two crusts, or ornament with strips
or lattice-work crust on top. A few stewed blackberries or
raspberries may be added to the apples.</p>


<h3>DRIED PEACH PIE</h3>

<p>Stew until soft, mash to a pulp, add sugar to sweeten, and
make the same as dried apple pie. If desired, one-third apricots
may be used.</p>


<h3>RAISIN PIE</h3>

<p>For three pies, stew one pound of raisins for nearly an hour
in enough water to cover them; add the juice of a lemon, and
a small cup of white sugar. Line the pie dishes with crust, fill
with raisins and a little of the juice, and sprinkle two tablespoonfuls
of flour over each pie. Bake with two crusts. For
lemon raisin pie add the juice and grated rind of one lemon.</p>


<h3>CREAM PIE</h3>

<p>Put one cup of milk to scald in a double boiler. Beat together
two eggs, leaving out the white of one, two even teaspoonfuls
of sifted flour stirred smooth in a little cold milk, and
two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar. When the milk is scalding
hot, add this mixture, and stir for a minute or two until it
thickens. It is better not to cook after it is thick, and the less
it is stirred, except to keep it from forming into lumps, the
better; add vanilla or lemon to flavor. Line the pie dish with
a crust, pricking well with a fork to prevent blistering, and
bake in a quick oven; then put the cream, which is already sufficiently
cooked, into the baked crust. Beat the white of the egg
to a stiff froth with a tablespoonful of sugar, and spread on
top of the pie. Place in the oven to brown slightly.</p>


<h3>CUSTARD PIE</h3>

<p>Line a pie dish with a crust, and fill with the following:
Three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and one teaspoonful
of flour; beat thoroughly together, and add milk enough to fill
the dish. Bake slowly until set, but do not allow to boil. As
soon as it puffs, and a knife can be cut into the custard and
come out clean, it is done. To be eaten cold, and on the same
day as baked.</p>


<h3>PUMPKIN PIE</h3>

<p>Cut the pumpkin in halves, remove the seeds, cut in slices,
and stew until dry and soft. Mash smooth, and for each pie
take one cup of stewed pumpkin, one-third cup of sugar, two
eggs, and about a pint of milk. Beat the eggs and sugar together,
stir in the pumpkin, and, lastly, add the milk; mix well,
and bake with an under crust only, until the custard is set.
Squash may be used instead of pumpkin. If more convenient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
two tablespoonfuls of flour may be used in place of the eggs.
A tablespoonful or two of molasses may also be added if
desired.</p>

</div></div></div>


<h3>PIE WITH UPPER CRUST ONLY</h3>

<p>Take a deep pie dish, place a small cup upside down in the
middle of it, and fill the dish with fruit, adding sugar as desired.
Place a border of crust around the edge of the dish, put on the
top crust, ornament the edges, and bake.</p>


<h3>TARTS</h3>

<p>Line shallow pie dishes or patty-pans with good crusts, fill
with the fruit, and bake. When done, remove from the oven,
and sprinkle with fine sugar.</p>

<p>Small tarts may be made by rolling crust out thin, and cutting
in shapes with a cake cutter, using half of them for the
under crust, and the other half for tops; ornament the tops by
cutting small holes in the center with a thimble or small fancy
mold. Bake quickly, and when done put together with fruit
jelly.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE PIE</h3>

<p>Boil for a short time several potatoes and onions, after which
slice them into a deep, buttered pie dish in layers; add to each
layer a little sage and well-steeped tapioca, and season with
salt. Cover with a crust and bake. A very economical and
wholesome pie.</p>


<h3>SAVORY PIE</h3>

<p>Soak one-half cup of tapioca in one cup of cold water for
one hour. Moisten enough stale bread in cold water to make
three cupfuls; put into a dish, and rub in two tablespoonfuls of
butter and one of flour. Then mix in one-half cup of stewed
fresh or canned tomatoes, two beaten eggs, one small onion
chopped fine, one tablespoonful of powdered sage, and salt to
taste. Put into a buttered pudding dish and pour over the
tapioca. Boil two eggs until hard, remove shells, cut into slices,
and place on top of the tapioca; add a few bits of butter, cover
with a crust, and bake in a moderate oven for twenty or thirty
minutes. Serve hot.</p>


<h3>MERINGUE FOR PIES</h3>

<p>To each stiffly beaten white of an egg, add a tablespoonful
of sugar, and spread on the pie after it is baked and allowed to
cool slightly; place in the oven for a few minutes. Care should
be taken that the oven is not too hot, or the covering will be
tough and leathery.</p>

<div class="caption">Dover Egg Beater</div>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is important that all the necessary materials should be
gathered together before beginning the cake. If baking-powder
is used, allow a teaspoonful to each cup of flour;
sift it in the flour, and measure the sugar; have the pans
for baking in readiness. Beat the whites and yolks of eggs
separately in china bowls, using a
Dover egg-beater. The whites should
be beaten till stiff enough to cut with
a knife, the yolks till they cease to
froth and begin to thicken. Cream
the butter by beating it, first warming the dish by rinsing
with hot water, if the weather is cold. Then add the sugar
slowly, then the beaten yolks of eggs; add a little of the
milk, then a part of the flour, thus alternating with the milk
and flour till all are used, being careful to have the mixture
always of about the same consistency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>Next fold in the stiffly beaten whites, add flavoring if
desired, and beat for a few moments. If fruit is used, fold
it in, well floured, the last thing, or it will sink to the bottom
of the cake.</p>

<p>The baking is an important part of cake-making. The
oven should be at a proper temperature; if too hot at first,
the cake browns too quickly, and a crust is formed over the
top before the cake has sufficient time to rise; if not hot
enough, the air that has been beaten in escapes before the
heat has time to expand it; the result is that the cake is
coarse-grained and heavy.</p>

<p>Have the oven less hot for cake than for bread, but
hotter for thin cake than for loaf cake. It is about right
for loaf cake made with butter when it turns a piece of
writing-paper a light brown in five minutes. About an
hour will be required to bake a loaf cake: from fifteen to
twenty minutes for small cakes and layer cakes.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Cake Pan</div>
</div>
<p>A tube cake pan, as shown in the accompanying cut, is
very good for baking ordinary cakes,
as the tube causes the cake to bake
more evenly, and renders it less liable
to fall.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to move the cake
after putting it in the oven, it should be done carefully, as
jarring is liable to make it fall. A cake is done when a
clean broom straw passed through the thickest part comes
out clean.</p>

<p>If a cake rises up, cracks open, and remains that way,
it has baked too fast, or too much flour has been used. To
bake properly, it should rise first on the edges, then in the
middle, crack open slightly, then settle till level, when it will
have closed nearly together again. The outside should be a
golden brown, the inside slightly moist, and fine grained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>In beating the yolks of eggs where both eggs and milk
are used, first rinse the bowl in which the yolks are to be
beaten with a little of the milk.</p>

<p>In beating the whites of the eggs, do not stop until they
are stiff, as they can not be beaten stiff after standing till
they have become liquid again. Eggs will beat stiffer if cold,
and beaten in a cold dish and in a cool room.</p>

<p>Jelly for filling should be beaten till smooth, then spread
between the layers before they are quite cool. In using dessicated
cocoanut, first moisten it with a little sweet cream.</p>

<p>Citron used in cake should be cut into fine strips. Currants
and raisins should be looked over, washed, dried, and
then be well floured before being added to the cake, as they
absorb moisture and tend to make the cake heavy. Rich cake
should be avoided. Sponge cake may be considered the
most healthful.</p>

<p>To make sponge cake, beat the yolks till thick and light-colored,
then beat in the sugar, add lemon-juice, or other
liquid and flavoring to be used. Then add the stiffly beaten
whites, sift in the flour over them, and fold all in together
without stirring or beating. Beating sponge cake after
adding the flour makes it firm and tough, as also does the
addition of too much flour. Sponge cake should be put
together lightly and quickly, and baked at once.</p>


<h3>SPONGE CAKE</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks of three eggs; then gradually add one cupful
of granulated sugar, one tablespoonful each of cold water and
lemon-juice. Add the beaten whites and one cupful of flour,
following general directions for making sponge cake as given
above.</p>


<h3>LEMON SPONGE CAKE</h3>

<p>Take four eggs, one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
with a little of the grated rind, and one cupful of flour.
Beat the yolks of the eggs to a foam, then beat in the sugar,
adding a little at a time; then add the lemon-juice and grated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
rind; beat the whites of the eggs until very stiff, then lightly
fold and chop them into the mixture. Slowly sift in the flour,
carefully working it in. Do not beat after the flour has been
added. Bake in two layers, and put together with fruit jelly or
lemon honey. See <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>.</p>


<h3>SPONGE LOAF CAKE</h3>

<p>Break ten eggs into a large bowl, add two large cupfuls of
granulated sugar, and beat together for half an hour without
pausing. Then add one cupful of sifted flour, the juice and
grated rind of one lemon, and one-fourth cup of cold water.
Turn into deep pans, sprinkle the top lightly with powdered
sugar, and bake about an hour in a moderate oven.</p>


<h3>GEM CAKES</h3>

<p>Beat to a foam the yolk of one egg, one cup of sugar, and
one cup of cold, thin, sweet cream; a little grated lemon rind
may be added for flavoring. Stir in slowly, beating thoroughly,
two cupfuls of flour into which a heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch
has been sifted. Beat until light and smooth; then add
the well-beaten whites of two eggs, stirring just enough to mix
them in. Turn into oiled, heated gem irons, and bake in a rather
quick oven.</p>


<h3>RICE CAKES</h3>

<p>Separate four eggs; add a pinch of salt to the whites, beat
until stiff, then set in a cool place. Beat the yolks for several
minutes, then slowly add one cupful of sugar, beating continuously;
carefully fold in the beaten whites, and lastly add one-half
cup of flour, sifted before measuring, and mixed with one-half
cup of ground rice; work in carefully, and quickly turn the
mixture into oiled patty-pans, or drop by spoonfuls into a large
oiled baking pan, and bake in a quick oven.</p>


<h3>CREAM CAKE</h3>

<p>One cupful each of sugar and sweet milk, one egg, one tablespoonful
of butter, two cupfuls of flour, and two teaspoonfuls
of baking-powder. Put together according to general directions.
Bake in three layers, and put together with a filling made as
follows: Heat one cupful of milk to boiling; to this add one-fourth
cup of sugar, one dessertspoonful of flour rubbed smooth
in a little cold milk reserved for this purpose, and one well-beaten
egg; boil until thickened, let cool a little, and spread
between the layers.</p>


<h3>NUT CAKE</h3>

<p>One and one-half cups of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter,
two eggs, two cupfuls of flour, with two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder,
and one cupful of milk. Put together according to general
directions. Lastly, stir in one cupful of chopped nuts, and
bake in a moderate oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>


<h3>FAVORITE CAKE</h3>

<p>Beat together for nearly an hour one cupful each of flour
and rice flour, twelve eggs, two cupfuls of sugar, and a spoonful
of caraway seeds. Bake in a tube cake pan.</p>


<h3>LAYER CAKE</h3>

<p>One and one-half cups sugar, half cup of butter, three eggs,
half cup of milk, and two heaping cups of sifted flour, with two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Bake in three layers, and put
together with a boiled frosting to which a cupful of chopped
nuts or raisins may be added.</p>


<h3>DELICATE CUP CAKE</h3>

<p>Take two eggs, beaten separately, one cup of sugar, one cup
of rich milk, two cups of flour, and teaspoonful of vanilla. Make
according to general directions; bake in patty pans, or gem irons.</p>


<h3>RAISED FRUIT CAKE</h3>

<p>Take one cup of light bread dough when ready for the pans,
put into a dish, and work into it one-half cup of oil or butter,
one egg well beaten, one cup of sugar, one-half cup of milk,
one and one-half cups of flour, and lastly one cup of English
currants or seedless raisins, chopped fine. Turn into an oiled
bread tin, let rise in a warm place for about an hour and a half,
or until light, then bake for nearly an hour in a moderate oven.</p>


<h3>FROSTING FOR CAKE</h3>

<p>Beat the white of one egg until stiff, add a teaspoonful of
lemon-juice, then gradually add one scant cup of powdered
sugar; beat very hard; flavor as desired. To color it a delicate
pink, add a little currant or strawberry juice; a yellow tint may
be obtained by grating orange or lemon rind, and using two
tablespoonfuls of the juice, first straining through a cloth.</p>


<h3>BOILED FROSTING</h3>

<p>Without stirring boil one cupful of sugar and two tablespoonfuls
of water in a saucepan until clear; then pour it upon
the stiffly beaten white of an egg, stirring well together, and
spread over the cake with a knife, which dip frequently into cold
water.</p>


<h3>CREAM ICING</h3>

<p>To two tablespoonfuls of cream and one teaspoonful of vanilla
or other flavoring add enough confectioner’s sugar to make
it stiff enough to spread. Orange, or other fruit juice, may be
used in place of the cream.</p>


<h3>ORANGE ICING</h3>

<p>Beat the yolk of one egg and add the juice and grated rind
of one orange and enough confectioner’s sugar to make it stiff
enough to spread.</p>

<h3>CEREAL COFFEE</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_091b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Coffee Strainer</div>
</div>
<p>To prepare, take three and one-half quarts of fresh bran,
one and one-half quarts corn-meal, two cupfuls
of molasses, and one cupful of boiling water;
mix all together thoroughly, bake in a large
dripping-pan in the oven till a rich brown
color; stir often to prevent scorching. Make
the same as ordinary coffee, only let boil a little longer.</p>


<h3>CRUST COFFEE</h3>

<p>Brown stale pieces of brown or white bread in the oven
slowly to a golden brown; then crush with a rolling-pin. Put
the crumbs in a thin cloth bag, filling only half full, and tying
near the top; put the bag in the coffee-pot and turn on hot
water, allowing seven parts of water to one of crumbs. Boil
five or ten minutes. Remove the bag, bring the coffee to a boil
again, and serve with cream and sugar. This makes a very
smooth drink, and is especially nice for the sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>


<h3>CORN COFFEE</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_092a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Coffee Mill</div>
</div>
<p>Brown common field corn as brown as possible
without burning; then pound, or grind
coarsely in a coffee-mill, and place in a covered
can ready for use. In making the coffee, mix the
white of an egg with three tablespoonfuls of the
ground grain, pour over three or four cups of
boiling water, and steep for ten or fifteen minutes.
Serve with cream and sugar.</p>

<p>Peas, wheat, barley, or rice may be prepared
in the same way.</p>


<h3>HOT MILK</h3>

<p>Heat the milk in a double boiler until the surface becomes
wrinkled. It should be drunk a few sips at a time. A bowl of
hot milk and brown bread forms a nourishing meal.</p>


<h3>CAMBRIC TEA</h3>

<p>Take a cup of boiling water, add a little cream, and sugar
to sweeten. A simple but pleasant and wholesome drink.</p>


<h3>EGG-NOG</h3>

<p>Beat one egg and a teaspoonful of powdered sugar to a
foam; add the juice of half a lemon, pour into a glass and fill
up with cold water.</p>


<h3>EGG-NOG, HOT</h3>

<p>Beat well together the yolk of one egg and a tablespoonful
of sugar; add one-half cup of hot milk or water, and the white
of the egg beaten to a stiff froth; stir lightly, and serve.</p>


<h3>LEMONADE, NO. 1</h3>
<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_092b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Lemon Drill</div>
</div>
<p>Roll the lemons till soft; cut into halves, and
with a lemon drill squeeze out sufficient juice to
make one cupful; add to this one cupful of white
sugar; as soon as the sugar dissolves, add about
two quarts of water, and serve. For lemon frappé
add the beaten whites of three eggs.</p>


<h3>LEMONADE, NO. 2</h3>

<p>For each quart desired, take the juice of three or four lemons,
and the rind of one. Peel the rind very thin, getting just
the yellow; place it in a pitcher with the juice of the lemons
and from four to six tablespoonfuls of white sugar. Pour over
enough hot water to make a quart in all; cover at once, and
let stand until cold; or pour over a spoonful or two of boiling
water to dissolve the sugar, and add the necessary quantity of
cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>


<h3>HOT LEMONADE</h3>

<p>To the juice of each lemon add a cupful of boiling water,
and sweeten to taste. Excellent for a cold.</p>


<h3>ORANGEADE</h3>

<p>Choose nice, juicy, ripe oranges, and make the same as Lemonade
Nos. 1 and 2, only using less sugar. This will be found
a much nicer drink than many imagine. Try it.</p>


<h3>FRUIT JUICE LEMONADE</h3>

<p>To a pint of lemonade prepared according to foregoing
recipes, add a half cup of strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, or
currant juice. This gives a nice color to the lemonade, besides
improving its flavor.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE LEMONADE</h3>

<p>Make the lemonade as indicated above, and flavor with a
few spoonfuls of pineapple juice.</p>


<h3>GRAPEADE</h3>

<p>Take two pounds of thoroughly ripe purple grapes, crush,
and strain the juice through a coarse cloth or jelly-bag. Add
to the juice three tablespoonfuls of white sugar, and dilute with
sufficient cold water to suit the taste.</p>


<h3>FRUIT JUICE DRINKS</h3>

<p>Take a small quantity of the juice of any stewed or canned
fruit. Dilute with water, and add sugar according to the acidity
of the juice. When fruit juice is not available, similar drinks
may be made by dissolving fruit jelly in warm water, and allowing
to cool. Such drinks are especially refreshing for the
sick.</p>


<h3>FRUIT PUNCH</h3>

<p>Boil two pounds of sugar and three quarts of water for five
minutes. Then strain, and add to it the juice of two lemons
and two oranges, and one pint of freshly grated pineapple. Let
stand for an hour or two, then add sufficient shaved ice to make
it palatable, a cupful of halved strawberries, a few raspberries,
and serve.</p>


<h3>BUTTERMILK</h3>

<p>If rich and thick, drop into it a piece of ice; or if not, place
on ice till cool. This is a very healthful drink, for, after the
butter, which is the carbonaceous or heat-producing element, is
removed, a most refreshing, nourishing quality remains.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> world is in need of knowledge how to prepare
and use simple, inexpensive, healthful foods. As
diseases increase in the animal creation, it will be more
and more necessary for those who desire to preserve their
health to come back to the diet originally given to man,—a
diet consisting chiefly of fruits, grains, and nuts, and
various legumes, roots, and herbs. At the rate disease is
increasing at the present time, it will not be long before
it will be unsafe to use animal products of any kind. It
is well, therefore, for all to learn how to prepare foods
without them.</p>

<p>Various nut, cereal, and legume preparations well supply
the place of flesh-meats. The different nut and vegetable
oils take the place of butter, cream, and other animal fats.</p>

<p>In the use of nuts, care should be taken not to use them
too freely, as they are a very rich and concentrated form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of food. Eaten sparingly in their natural state in connection
with the meals, or properly combined with other less
concentrated foods, they fill an important place in a natural
dietary.</p>

<p>A little experience in the use of vegetable oils will
convince any one that they are not only palatable, but far
more cleanly and wholesome than many of the ordinary
fats used in cooking.</p>

<p>The following recipes are designed to aid especially in
preparing foods in this manner:—</p>


<h3>PEANUT BUTTER</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Universal Chopper
 and Nut-Butter Mill</div>
</div>
<p>Put the shelled peanuts in a pan in a slow
oven, leaving the door slightly ajar; allow to
stay in till so dry that the hulls will rub off
easily, but in no case allow to brown or burn.
When sufficiently dry, put into a bag, tie up
closely, and knead or roll on a table with the
hands until the husks are well loosened; separate
the husks from the nuts by turning from
one pan into another in the wind. Grind, and
cook for several hours in a double boiler with
no water added to the nuts. Put away to use
as occasion requires.</p>


<h3>PEANUT CREAM</h3>

<p>Mix one tablespoonful of nut butter with two or three spoonfuls
of water to a smooth cream; then add one-half cupful of
water, a little salt, and stir well together.</p>


<h3>PEANUT MILK</h3>

<p>Make the same as peanut cream, only add more water.</p>


<h3>ALMOND BUTTER</h3>

<p>Pour boiling water over the shelled nuts, and let stand from
three to five minutes; then drain, and slip off the husks with
thumb and finger. Put in a warm place till thoroughly dry;
grind, and put away for future use.</p>


<h3>ALMOND MILK AND CREAM</h3>

<p>Proceed the same as with peanut cream and milk, only using
a little more water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>


<h3>COCOANUT MILK AND CREAM</h3>
<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_096.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Cocoanut Scraper</div>
</div>
<p>Select good cocoanuts with milk in them. Let the milk out
of the soft eye; then, holding the nut in the left hand, strike
sharp, quick blows with a hammer or iron bar on the meridian
line, causing the nut
to revolve by tossing
it up slightly, when it
will break in halves.
Grate on an iron or steel cocoanut scraper, made as shown in
accompanying cut, placing the scraper board across a chair,
with a pan upon the floor to catch the grated nut, while the
operator sits upon the board, takes half of the broken nut in
the hollow of both hands, scraping it back and forth over the
sharp teeth till all the meat has been finely scraped from the
shell. For each grated nut pour over a quart of hot water; stir
well, then squeeze and strain through a strong, coarse cloth.
Empty the cocoanut from the cloth into a saucepan, pour over
a little more hot water, stir, and strain through the cloth a
second time, to get out all the milk. This makes cocoanut milk.
Using half the quantity of water makes good cream; or let the
milk stand an hour and skim off the top for thick cream.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT-OIL</h3>

<p>Cocoanut-oil can generally be purchased in the market from
wholesale druggists, though it is sometimes difficult to get that
which is not rancid. It can be made by taking the cream from
a half dozen or dozen nuts, treated as above, only allowing the
milk to stand over night before skimming, and boiling the
cream in an iron vessel, without stirring, until all the water is
evaporated. When done, the sediment will be found browned,
and adhering to the bottom of the vessel. Bottle, and set away
for use.</p>

<p>Ko-nut is a pure, refined cocoanut-oil, which does not turn
rancid, and is, therefore, very nice, and far preferable to the
cocoanut-oil ordinarily obtainable for cooking purposes.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE OIL</h3>

<p>There are various good cooking oils, among which may be
mentioned Wesson’s Cooking Oil, and Fairbank’s White Cooking
Oil, both refined products of cottonseed-oil. Olive-oil may
also be used in cooking.</p>


<h3>HOME-MADE GRANOLA</h3>

<p>Take slices of brown, white, or whole wheat bread, place in
a moderate oven until a light brown, break in pieces, and grind
coarsely through a mill. Or, take a cup each of wheat-meal
and white flour, one-half cup each of corn-meal and rolled oats
or corn-meal and rye flour, and enough cold water to make a
stiff dough; knead well, roll thin, cut in squares, and bake until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
dry and brittle; grind coarsely, and serve with thin cream, hot
or cold milk, cocoanut milk, or fruit juice; or to each pint of
boiling milk or water stir in one cupful of granola, add a little
salt, cook a few minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3>NUTMEAT</h3>

<p>Take one cup of peanut butter, one and one-half cups hot
water, three heaping tablespoonfuls of gluten, and one level teaspoonful
of salt. Mix all well together, and cook in a double
boiler from four to five hours. A small onion grated fine and a
teaspoonful of powdered sage may be added if desired.</p>


<h3>PROTOSE STEAK</h3>

<p>Cut protose into slices half an inch thick. Lay on an oiled
tin and place in the oven until nicely browned.</p>


<h3>PROTOSE CUTLETS</h3>

<p>Take one pound of protose and cut into slices three or four
inches long and one inch wide, lay on an oiled tin, and place
in the oven till well heated; have ready an egg well beaten, to
which add a sprinkle of salt; take the protose from the oven,
and dip each piece in the beaten egg, then roll in fine bread
crumbs, place back on the pan, and set in the oven until nicely
browned.</p>


<h3>NUT GRAVY</h3>

<p>Blend one tablespoonful of nut butter with a little water;
stir it into a pint of boiling water; salt, and thicken with two
tablespoonfuls of browned flour moistened with cold water;
boil five or ten minutes. A few spoonfuls of stewed, strained
tomatoes will improve it. Nice with vegetables or toasts.</p>


<h3>EGGS IN NEST ON ZWIEBACK</h3>

<p>Take six eggs, or as many as required, break, and separate,
by putting all the whites in one bowl and each yolk in a cup
by itself containing a spoonful or two of cold water. Moisten
six slices of zwieback by pouring over them hot water and
quickly draining, and place side by side in a large shallow
baking pan. Beat the whites of the eggs until very stiff, and
place an equal amount on top of each slice of zwieback. Make
a hollow in the center of the whites, lift the yolks out of the
water from the cups with a tablespoon, being careful not to
break them, and place a yolk in each hollow. Sprinkle over a
little salt, and place in the oven until the whites are a delicate
brown. Serve as soon as done. A nice dish for the sick.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Food</span> for the sick should generally be of a very simple
character. It should be such as will furnish the most
nourishment with the least tax upon the digestive organs.
It should be prepared with care and scrupulous cleanliness,
well cooked, and served in the most inviting manner. Cover
the tray with clean white linen, and use the daintiest dishes
the house affords.</p>

<p>Other dishes suitable for the sick may be found among
the Toasts, Breads, Fruits, Wholesome Drinks, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg"  alt="Food For Infants" />
</div>



<h3>OATMEAL WATER AND MILK</h3>

<p>For an infant under three months, put one tablespoonful of
fine oatmeal into a pint of boiling water, boil for an hour, replenishing
with boiling water to keep the quantity good; strain,
and add one cup of sterilized milk. Feed in bottle. For infants
from three to six months, use equal portions of milk and oatmeal
water, and after six months, two-thirds milk.</p>


<h3>SUBSTITUTE FOR MOTHER’S MILK, NO. 1</h3>

<p>Take one ounce cow’s milk, two ounces cream, three drams
milk sugar, one grain bicarbonate of soda, and one ounce of
water. Increase the quantity of milk and cream as the child
gets older.</p>


<h3>SUBSTITUTE FOR MOTHER’S MILK, NO. 2</h3>

<p>Take one tablespoonful of cream, four of milk, two of limewater,
and four of sweetened water. Sugar of milk, two ounces
to a pint of water, is preferable to ordinary sugar for preparing
the sweetened water. This will generally agree with the most
delicate stomach.</p>


<h3>WHITE OF EGG AND WATER</h3>

<p>Stir well the white of an egg into a cupful of as warm water
as can be used without coagulating the egg. Good for infants
suffering with extremely weak digestion, and unable to take
milk.</p>

</div>


<h3>TO STERILIZE MILK</h3>

<p>As soon as received, heat to nearly the boiling-point; then
remove from the fire, and cool as quickly as possible, by
pouring it into clean pans, previously scalded, and placing
these in cold water.</p>


<h3>COTTAGE CHEESE</h3>

<p>Set a pan containing a quart or more of thick, sour milk
in a pan of hot water, or on the back of the stove; as soon as
the whey separates from the curd, line a colander with a cloth,
pour in the scalded milk, tie the corners of the cloth together,
and hang up till well drained; put into a bowl, add one-fourth
teaspoonful of salt, and enough sweet cream to make as moist
as desired; mix smooth with a spoon, turn lightly into a dish,
and serve.</p>


<h3>HOMINY OR HULLED CORN</h3>

<p>To hull four quarts of corn, use one heaping tablespoonful
of soda, and water enough to cover the corn. Boil for four
hours, or until the hull is well loosened and can be readily
removed. Then wash in cold water thoroughly, stirring, rubbing,
and rinsing until the hulls have all been turned off. Soak
in clear water overnight to remove all traces of soda, and cook
in a kettle or large saucepan all day in clear water, stirring
occasionally to prevent burning on the bottom, and replenishing
with hot water as needed. Season with salt, put into a
jar, and keep in a cool place.</p>


<h3>DRIED SWEET CORN</h3>

<p>Remove the husks and silks, boil and cut from the cob as
directed for stewed sweet corn on <a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>. Spread thinly on
a cloth or on shallow tins, and place in the sun to dry. Turn
over occasionally, take in in the evening, and put out to dry
every day until thoroughly hard and dry. To keep off flies
and insects, cover with mosquito webbing. Corn may also be
dried in a warm, open oven, if careful not to allow the oven
to get too hot. When dry, soak and cook the same as stewed
sweet corn, only longer; or with beans soaked overnight.</p>


<h3>DRIED APPLES</h3>

<p>Take good, ripe apples, pare, quarter, core, and cut into thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
slices; spread on shallow tins, and place in the oven until well
heated through, then in the sun or in a moderate, open oven
until thoroughly dried. Turn the fruit over occasionally each
day while drying. Wire screens or webbings are serviceable
in keeping off the flies. Other fruits may be dried in a similar
manner.</p>


<h3>POP-CORN</h3>

<p>Shell, and place a handful in a wire popper or frying-pan,
covering tightly; shake constantly over a hot fire, being careful
not to burn. When the popping ceases, it is done; add a little
salt and butter; mix with it a little thick sugar sirup, or molasses
boiled down, and press it into balls with the hands
slightly oiled.</p>


<h3>TO KEEP APPLES, ORANGES, AND LEMONS</h3>

<p>Wrap each separately in tissue paper, and lay so as not to
touch each other, in a cool, dry place.</p>


<h3>TO KEEP EGGS</h3>

<p>To twelve quarts of water add two pints of fresh, slaked
lime and one pint of common salt; mix well, immerse newly-laid
eggs, and set in a cool place. Or, dip the eggs into a
solution of gum arabic—equal parts gum and water—let dry,
then dip again. When dry, wrap separately in paper, and pack
in sawdust, bran, or salt.</p>


<h3>TO PRESERVE LEMON-JUICE</h3>

<p>When lemons are cheap, purchase several dozen at once.
With the hand press each lemon on the table, rolling it back
and forth briskly a few times; cut into halves, and extract the
juice with a lemon drill into a bowl or tumbler,—never into
a tin; strain the juice through a wire strainer, colander, or
coarse cloth to remove the seeds and pulp; add a pint of water
and a pound of white sugar to the juice of each dozen lemons,
and boil in an enameled saucepan for about ten minutes; then
bottle and set in a cool place, and it is ready for use. A tablespoonful
or two of the sirup in a glass of water makes a cooling,
healthful drink.</p>


<h3>COOKED PINEAPPLE</h3>

<p>Pare with a sharp knife, cut into thin slices, divide the
slices into quarters, put into a saucepan with one-half cup of
water, and a very little sugar for each pineapple; cover with
a china plate or enameled lid, and cook slowly for about two
hours.</p>


<h3>TO FROST FRUITS</h3>

<p>Secure nice bunches of cherries, currants, grapes, or berries
with the stems on; dip them into the stiffly beaten white of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
an egg, then into powdered sugar, and place on a plate or
clean white paper so as not to touch each other, to dry. Then
place the fruit on a glass dish, chill, and serve.</p>


<h3>UNLEAVENED BREAD FOR SACRAMENTAL USE</h3>

<p>Take three cups of white flour, half a cup of thick sweet
cream, a pinch of salt, and a little cold water. Sift the flour
into a dish, add the salt and cream, and rub together
thoroughly; then moisten with cold water till of the consistency
of thick pie crust. Knead and roll well with the hand
for fifteen minutes; then roll out to about a quarter of an
inch in thickness, and cut into cakes four inches square. Mark
out each cake into half-inch squares with a knife, so that when
baked it may easily be broken, and prick each square with a
fork to prevent blistering. Lay on floured baking tins, and
bake in a quick oven, being careful not to scorch or burn.</p>


<h3>UNFERMENTED WINE FOR SACRAMENTAL USE</h3>

<p>Secure good grapes, the small, dark wine grape is preferable,
and proceed as with grape juice on <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>.</p>


<h3>TO CUT LEMONS FOR GARNISHING</h3>

<p>Divide slices of lemons into four parts, and use on salads
and other dishes, placing the points toward the center.</p>


<h3>HOW TO CUT BREAD</h3>
<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bread Knife</div>
</div>
<p>Bread should be cut into smooth, even slices, not too thick,
the full length or width of the
loaf. If large, the slices may be
divided. The Clauss, or scalloped-edged,
bread-knife does the work nicely. If bread or
cake is to be cut while warm, the knife should first be heated.</p>


<h3>NUT RELISH</h3>

<p>Take one cup of almond or peanut butter, one cup of dried
figs, or seedless raisins, and one cup of gluten. Mix well
together, then grind twice through a nut mill. Mold into a
square pan, then cut into inch squares one-half inch thick,
similar in size to caramels.</p>


<h3>NUT DAINTIES</h3>

<p>Crack English walnuts so as not to break the meats. Take
the two halves from each nut and press on each side of a nut
relish square. When sufficient are prepared, place in a dish
with an equal number of olives.</p>

</div>


<h4>SABBATH DINNERS</h4>

<p>The Sabbath is the day of rest. In order that it may be
devoted by all to religious exercises, holy meditation, and
spiritual delight, it should be as free as possible from the
ordinary duties and cares of life. To make it thus, preparation
on the day before is necessary. The Lord calls the day before
the Sabbath “the preparation” day. Luke 23:54. Of the work
to be done on this day he says: “To-morrow is the rest of the
holy Sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake
to-day, and seethe [boil] that ye will seethe; and that which
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.”
Ex. 16:23.</p>

<p>The Sabbath should not be made a day of feasting. The
labor of the week being laid aside, a moderate amount of plain,
wholesome food is all that is necessary. To gormandize on
this day, as is the custom with many, causes the mind to become
dull and stupid, and unfits it for spiritual devotion.</p>

<p>With proper planning, very little, if any, cooking need ever
be done on the Sabbath, aside from simply warming over
some of the foods prepared the previous day.</p>

<p>Brown bread, fruit bread-sticks, or French rolls; warmed
up potatoes, or potatoes with cream; baked or boiled beans;
split pea or lentil soup, with croutons; sago, tapioca, or some
other simple pudding or pie; canned or stewed fruit; and fresh
fruits and nuts, make an excellent Sabbath dinner. All these
may be prepared on the previous day. The potatoes may be
boiled ready to warm up, the beans baked or boiled, the peas
or lentils cooked and rubbed through a colander ready to add
the seasoning and necessary water for soup, the croutons prepared,
the fruit stewed, the pudding or pie baked, and the nuts
cracked. Then the dinner may be made ready quickly, and
with but little effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>


<h3>FOOD COMBINATIONS</h3>

<p>Because of their chemical nature, the time required to digest
them, and the place where, and the juices with which, they are
digested, some foods do not combine as well as others. While
the young and those with sound stomachs and vigorous digestion
may experience little or no inconvenience from improper
and more varied combinations, to continue their use is likely
in time seriously to impair the digestion. Dyspeptics and
those troubled with slow digestion will find it to their advantage
to avoid such combinations as fruits and vegetables,
milk and vegetables, sugar and milk, milk and fruits; and, when
fruits are taken, to eat them at the close of the meal. The
following are good combinations: Grains and fruits; fruits and
nuts; grains, fruits, and nuts; grains, legumes, and vegetables;
grains and milk. An excellent rule to follow is to avoid a large
variety at any meal, and let natural cravings indicate largely the
kinds of food eaten. Above all, use common sense, and relish
what you eat.</p>

<h3 id="NUTRITIVE_VALUE_OF_FOODS">NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FOODS</h3>


<p>The nutritive food elements are classified into three groups.
The <i>nitrogenous</i>, or muscle- and tissue-building; the <i>carbonaceous</i>,
or heat- and energy-producing; and the <i>mineral</i>, or the
bone- and nerve-building.</p>

<p>Albumen, gluten, and casein belong to the nitrogenous;
starch, sugar, and fats to the carbonaceous; and salts, cellulose
portions, and inorganic substances to the mineral.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous elements are of prime importance, as they
nourish the brain, nerves, muscles, and the more highly vitalized
tissues of the body. The carbonaceous, however, are required
in much larger quantities, the correct proportion being
about eight or ten of carbonaceous to one of nitrogenous.</p>

<h3 id="HOW_TO_BECOME_A_VEGETARIAN">HOW TO BECOME A VEGETARIAN</h3>

<p>The fact that many people abstain from flesh food altogether,
and maintain their full vigor, is good proof that the
eating of flesh-meat is not essential to either life or health.
But those accustomed all their life to the use of meat may
need to use a little caution in making a change to a vegetarian
diet. A good way to begin might be to limit one’s self
at first to the use of meat once or twice a week, discarding
it as better foods are substituted. The British Vegetarian
Society, in “How to Begin,” gives the following suggestions
for those desiring to make this change:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i>Steadily persevere.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Use Variety.</i>—Nature affords the most bountiful abundance.
Have something new on your table frequently, especially fruits.</p>

<p>3. <i>Choose foods which compel mastication.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>Drink Little.</i>—If fruits be used plentifully—condiments,
hot foods, and stimulants avoided, and frequently bathing practised—little
drink will be required.</p>

<p>5. <i>Prefer natural to manufactured foods.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>Avoid Excess.</i>—Most people eat too much; a smaller quantity
of food, well masticated, will nourish and sustain the system
best.</p>

<p>7. <i>Eat Seldom.</i>—Not more than thrice daily. “Little and
often” is an unwise maxim for any healthy person. And if you
wish sound sleep, and an appetite for breakfast, avoid suppers.</p>

<p>8. <i>Let your food be attractively prepared.</i></p>

<p>9. <i>See That Your Life be Right in Other Respects.</i>—Eat food
which is pure of its kind, agreeably prepared, at right times,
and in right quantities; breathe pure air by night and by day;
take physical exercise (if possible in the open air) daily; and
practise strict cleanliness.</p>

<p>10. <i>Get Mind and Body in Harmony.</i>—Remember that man’s
physical condition, and the state of his spiritual and mental
faculties are closely and mutually inter-dependent. It is, therefore,
a primary essential to keep these also in health; and to
see that they be usefully, tranquilly, and constantly occupied
and cultivated.</p></blockquote>


<h4>VEGETARIANISM IN LONDON</h4>

<p>Vegetarianism has worked an improvement, and its many
restaurants in London show how the taste for this diet has
been on the increase of late. One very great and undeniable
advantage in the teaching of this school is the showing us
how many foods we possess, and how few, comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
speaking, we have used. Also, it proves to us how much
cheaper we could live by utilizing all the foods at our command
except meat, and abstaining from it.—<i>Mrs. Beeton.</i></p>


<h3>RULES FOR DYSPEPTICS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyspepsia</span>, or indigestion, is coming to be so general
as to demand serious attention. The following rules will be
found valuable to those suffering with this complaint:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Eat slowly, chewing the food very thoroughly, even
more so, if possible, than is required in health. The more time
the food spends in the mouth, the less it will need to spend
in the stomach.</p>

<p>2. Avoid drinking at meals; at most, take a few sips of
warm drink at the close of the meal, if the food is very dry.</p>

<p>3. In general, dyspeptic stomachs manage dry food better
than that containing much fluid.</p>

<p>4. Eat neither very hot nor very cold food. The best
temperature is about that of the body. Avoid exposure to cold
after eating.</p>

<p>5. Be careful to avoid excess in eating. Eat no more than
the wants of the system require. Sometimes less than is really
needed must be taken when the digestion is very weak.
Strength depends not on what is eaten, but on what is digested.</p>

<p>6. Never take violent exercise, either mental or physical,
just before or just after a meal. Do not go to sleep immediately
after eating.</p>

<p>7. Do not eat more than three times a day, and make the
last meal very light. For many dyspeptics two meals are
better than more.</p>

<p>8. Avoid eating two meals too close together, as this is
one of the most prolific causes of indigestion.</p>

<p>9. Observe regularity in eating; do not eat between meals.</p>

<p>10. Never eat when very tired, whether exhausted from mental
or physical labor. Rest first.</p>

<p>11. Never eat when the mind is worried, or the temper is
ruffled, if possible to avoid doing so.</p>

<p>12. Eat only food that is easy of digestion, avoiding complicated
and indigestible dishes, and taking from but one to
three kinds at a meal.</p>

<p>13. Omit a meal occasionally, or fast a day. This will give
the stomach time to rest and recuperate, and will be found
beneficial.</p>

<p>14. If the stomach or bowels feel weak or tender, apply hot
fomentations over them.</p>

<p>15. Most persons will be benefited by the use of oatmeal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Graham flour, cracked wheat, whole wheat flour, and other
whole-grain preparations, though many will find it necessary
to avoid vegetables, especially when fruits are taken.</p></blockquote>

<h3>HOUSEHOLD HINTS</h3>

<p>Every housewife should take pride in keeping her home neat
and tidy. “Order is heaven’s first law.”</p>

<p>Sinks and drains should be frequently cleaned and disinfected.</p>

<p>Dish-cloths should always be washed out after using; otherwise
they are liable to become foul and full of germs.</p>

<p>After washing the dishes, pour over them scalding water,
and wipe quickly with a clean dry cloth. This insures cleanliness,
and gives a nice polish.</p>

<p>Scour steel knives after each meal.</p>

<p>Sweep out the corners, and under the tables and chairs as
well as the middle of the room. “Dirt may be hated, but should
never be hidden.”</p>

<p>Pare vegetables and fruits thin; study how to use left-over
foods; save the bread crumbs for puddings and scalloped vegetables.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
“Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be
lost.”</p>
